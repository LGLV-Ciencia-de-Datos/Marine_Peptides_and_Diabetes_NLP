J,FUTURE FOODS,2024.0,Pharmacoinformatics and cellular studies of algal peptides as functional molecules to modulate type-2 diabetes markers,"Novel dietary strategies are urgently needed to address the limitations of current management and treatment options of Type -2 Diabetes (T2D). Marine algae -derived peptides (MAP) represent a promising avenue, although, their potential remains mostly underexplored. This study employs pharmacoinformatics and in vitro methods to evaluate the antidiabetic properties of MAP and provide new insights their mechanisms to mitigate the prevalence of T2D. Through a systematic search and predictive modeling, peptides were identified and assessed for bioactivity, toxicity, and drug -likeness. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations with protein targets related to T2D identified binding sites that be used to optimize the activity of MAP. The structure -activity relationship profile of MAP reveals 13 candidates with probable activity (Pa) scores >0.4, indicative of insulin promoter. The peptide FDGIP (P13;Phe-Asp-Gly-Ile-Pro) from Caulerpa lentillifera had the best in silico assessment value compared to 50 other peptides and its activity was confirmed by in vitro data (e.g.EC50 60.4 and 57.9 for alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitions). Interestingly, in 3T3 -L1 cells, P13 exhibited inhibitory activities against transcription factors and hormones (MAPK8-JNK1/PPARGC1A/Ghrelin/GLP-1/CPT-1) that can regulate blood sugar and decrease as anti -diabetes.

J,APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY NUTRITION AND METABOLISM,2010.0,Treatment with marine collagen peptides modulates glucose and lipid metabolism in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"This study was aimed at examining the therapeutic effects of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) from fish hydrolysate in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 100 diabetic patients and 50 healthy controls were recruited. Diabetic patients were randomized into treatment and control groups. The patients in the treatment group received an additional 13 g of MCPs daily for 3 months. Their blood samples were collected before, and 1.5 and 3 months after, treatment to evaluate glucose and lipid metabolism. The levels of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, prostacyclin (PGI(2)), and adipokines were determined. Significantly reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, human glycated hemoglobin A1c (GHbA1c), fasting blood insulin, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and free-fatty acids, but increased levels of insulin sensitivity index and HDL were observed in T2DM patients following treatment with MCPs for 1.5 and 3 months. The values of these measures were significantly lower or higher than those of patient controls (p < 0.01), respectively. Interestingly, significantly decreased levels of hs-CRP and NO, but increased levels of bradykinin, PGI(2), and adiponectin were detected in MCP-treated T2DM patients (p < 0.01), as compared with their basal values or the levels in patient controls.

J,THALASSAS,2025.0,Marine-Derived Anti-diabetic Compounds: A Review of Potentials and Prospects,"Diabetes mellitus is a long-term metabolic condition characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood caused by a lack of insulin or insulin resistance, presenting a major worldwide health issue. Conventional treatments are successful but frequently have restrictions and adverse reactions, highlighting the necessity for new antidiabetic medications. This review discusses the latest progress in using marine-derived compounds for treating diabetes, focusing on active substances found in marine organisms such as algae, invertebrates, and microorganisms. Substances like terpenoids, fucoidans, and marine peptides have displayed promising effects. Specifically, fucoidan from Undaria pinnatifida has been found to enhance insulin sensitivity by 30% in preclinical studies, while peptides from Spirulina platensis have reduced postprandial glucose levels by 25%. These substances display mechanisms such as enzyme blocking and antioxidant properties, showing potential for treating diabetes and combatting drug resistance. Yet, challenges remain in the scalability and cost-efficiency of marine-derived compounds, as finding sustainable extraction methods is difficult and production costs could be higher than those of traditional treatments. The review highlights the importance of progress in green extraction and nanotechnology to improve effectiveness and availability. Incorporating these agents into current treatments has the potential to enhance treatment results, but additional comparative studies on cost and accessibility are necessary to thoroughly assess their clinical viability.

However, human amylin has a high tendency to aggregate, forming isolated amylin deposits that are observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In search of new inhibitors of amylin aggregation, we undertook the chemical analyses of five marine macroorganisms encountered in high populations in the Red Sea and selected a panel of 10 metabolites belonging to different chemical classes to evaluate their ability to inhibit the formation of amyloid deposits in the human amylin peptide. The thioflavin T assay was used to examine the kinetics of amyloid aggregation, and atomic force microscopy was employed to conduct a thorough morphological examination of the formed fibrils. The potential ability of these compounds to interact with the backbone of peptides and compete with beta-sheet formation was analyzed by quantum calculations, and the interactions with the amylin peptide were computationally examined using molecular docking. Despite their structural similarity, it could be observed that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of pyrrolidinones 9 and 10 with the protein sheets result in one case in a stable aggregation, while in the other, they cause distortion from aggregation.",10.3390/biom14080951,"Alghrably, Mawadda"," Tammam, Mohamed A."," Koutsaviti, Aikaterini"," Roussis, Vassilios"," Lopez, Xabier"," Bennici, Giulia"," Sharfalddin, Abeer"," Almahasheer, Hanan"," Duarte, Carlos M."," Emwas, Abdul-Hamid"," Ioannou, Efstathia"," Jaremko, Mariusz",,,,

J,MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS,2017.0,Marine collagen peptides reduce endothelial cell injury in diabetic rats by inhibiting apoptosis and the expression of coupling factor 6 and microparticles,"The present study aimed to elucidate the role of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) in protection of carotid artery vascular endothelial cells (CAVECs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mechanism underlying this process. In an in vivo experiment, diabetic Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups (n= 10/group): Diabetes control, and three diabetes groups administered low, medium and high doses of MCPs (2.25, 4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively). Another 10 healthy rats served as the control. In an in vitro experiment, human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in normal and high concentrations of glucose with or without MCPs (3.0, 15.0 and 30.0 mg/ml, respectively) for 24, 48 or 72 h. Blood vessel/endothelial construction, inflammatory exudation and associated molecular biomarkers in CAVECs were detected and analyzed. The results of the present study demonstrated that in rats, MCP treatment for 4 weeks significantly lowered blood glucose and attenuated endothelial thinning and inflammatory exudation in carotid-artery vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, the high-glucose intervention significantly increased cell apoptosis in HUVECs, and medium and high doses of MCPs (4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively) partially ameliorated this high glucose-mediated apoptosis and decreased levels of apoptosis biomarkers. In conclusion, a moderate oral MCP dose (> 4.5 g/kg body weight/day) may be a novel therapeutic tool to protect against early cardiovascular complications associated with T2DM by inhibiting apoptosis and reducing the expression of coupling factor 6 and microparticles.",10.3892/mmr.2017.7061,"Zhu, Cuifeng"," Zhang, Wei"," Liu, Jianguo"," Mu, Bo"," Zhang, Fan"," Lai, Nannan"," Zhou, Jianxin"," Xu, Aimin"," Li, Yong",,,,,,,

Antioxidant peptides have been reported to attenuate diabetes complications by regulating levels of oxidative stress, but few studies have focused on peptides from marine bone collagen. In this study, we prepared the peptides with a molecular weight of less than 1 kD (HNCP) by enzymolysis and ultrafiltration derived from Harpadon nehereus bone collagen. Furthermore, the effects of HNCP on blood glucose, blood lipid, liver structure and function, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism were studied using HE staining, kit detection, and Western blotting experiment in streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. After the 240 mg/kg HNCP treatment, the levels of blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mice decreased by 32.8%, 42.2%, and 43.2%, respectively, while the levels of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen increased by 142.0% and 96.4%, respectively. The antioxidant enzymes levels and liver function in the diabetic mice were markedly improved after HNCP intervention. In addition, the levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glucokinase (GK), and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (p-GSK3 beta) in the liver were markedly up-regulated after HNCP treatment, but the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PEPCK1) were down-regulated.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce new approaches for treating obesity. Bioactive peptides have been used to treat metabolic disorders-such as type-2 diabetes and obesity; while also possessing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-viral properties. However, the development of these peptides has taken backstage due to their size, reduced stability, poor delivery and bioavailability, fast rate of degradation etc. But with the emergence of newer techniques for multifunctional peptides, mimetics, peptide analogs, and aptamers, there is a sudden revival in this therapeutic field. An increased attention is required for development of the natural peptides from food and marine sources which can mimic the function of mediators involved in weight management to avoid obesity. Herein, the search for the structures of anti-obesity peptides was carried out in order to establish their potential for drug development in future. An extensive search for the current status of endogenous, food and marine peptides, with reference to novel and interesting experimental approaches based on peptidomimetics for controlling obesity, was performed. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-specific agonist, GLP-1 dual and triple agonists, neuropeptides and prolactin-releasing peptide mimetics were specifically examined for their anti-obesity role. Novel peptides, mimetics, and synthesis interventions are transpiring and might offer safer alternatives for otherwise scarcely available safe antiobesity drug.

J,IIUM MEDICAL JOURNAL MALAYSIA,2025.0,Antidiabetic Effects of Coffee Enriched with Maca and Marine Collagen Peptide (Blackbelt®) in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Rat Model,"INTRODUCTION: The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported 463 million global cases of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2019. Lepidium meyenii (maca) and marine collagen peptide (MCP) have individually shown potential in alleviating T2DM symptoms, but their combined effects remain underexplored. This study evaluated the impact of Blackbelt (R) coffee, enriched with maca and MCP, on fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and pancreatic and liver histology in a T2DM rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male rats with a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with metformin, maca, MCP, Maca/MCP (R) (Blackbelt (R) formulation), or Blackbelt (R) coffee for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were monitored, and fasting serum insulin, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance), HOMA-B (ss-cell function), and QUICKI (insulin sensitivity) were assessed. Histological analysis of the pancreas and liver was performed using haematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, treatments significantly reduced FBG levels compared to control (p<0.05), with Blackbelt (R) coffee notably increasing insulin production (p<0.05). All groups showed decreased HOMA-IR (p<0.05), and both metformin and Blackbelt (R) coffee groups had significant HOMA-B score increases (p<0.05). Histological analysis revealed improved pancreatic health in all treated groups, with significant liver histology enhancement in the Blackbelt (R) coffee group. CONCLUSIONS: Blackbelt (R) coffee improved FBG levels, insulin resistance, and ss-cell function more effectively than maca or MCP alone, and surpassed metformin in insulin production and hepatoprotective effects. Despite its promising potential for diabetes therapy, further research is needed to understand the synergistic effects of maca and MCP and the contribution of the coffee components.",10.31436/imjm.v23i04.2622,"Othman, N.

J,MARINE DRUGS,2024.0,Marine Microalgal Products with Activities against Age-Related Cardiovascular Diseases,"Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and it is estimated that 17.9 million people die of it each year. The risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are attributable to an unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, stress, genetic predisposition, diabetes, obesity, and aging. Marine microalgae have been the subject of numerous studies for their potential activity against several human diseases. They produce a plethora of primary and secondary metabolites such as essential nutrients, vitamins, pigments, and omega-3 fatty acid. Many of these molecules have antioxidant properties and have been shown to play a role in the prevention of heart diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize recent studies on the discovery of marine microalgal compounds and bioactivities for cardiovascular diseases, including in vitro and in vivo studies, showing and discussing recent discoveries and trends. The most promising results were found for microalgal polysaccharides, peptides and carotenoids. In conclusion, the overall data summarized here show that microalgae-based supplementation has the potential to improve age-related cardiovascular diseases and we expect more clinical studies in the future.",10.3390/md22050229,"Yurika, Nova"," Montuori, Eleonora"," Lauritano, Chiara",,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE,2017.0,Effects of marine collagen peptides on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats,"The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance using a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Forty T2DM obese Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of MCPs or a vehicle control for 4 weeks. Blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation were measured. The expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscles and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) in livers of T2DM rats was also measured. It was found that in the group of 9.0 g/kg/day MCPs significantly improved glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and increased the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). In addition, the groups of 4.5 and 2.25 g/kg/day MCPs significantly improved liver steatosis. It was also found that MCPs decreased expression of oxidative stress biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines in T2DM rats. In conclusion, medium and high doses of MCPs (ae4.5 g/kg/day) improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in T2DM rats. These beneficial effects of MCPs may be mediated by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation and by up-regulating GLUT4, and PPAR-alpha activity.",10.1007/s13197-017-2663-z,"Zhu, CuiFeng"," Zhang, Wei"," Mu, Bo"," Zhang, Fan"," Lai, NanNan"," Zhou, JianXin"," Xu, AiMin"," Liu, JianGuo"," Li, Yong",,,,,,,

J,DENTAL MATERIALS JOURNAL,2021.0,Functional roles of fish collagen peptides on bone regeneration,"Fish collagen peptides (FCP) derived from the skin, bones and scales are commercially used as a functional food or dietary supplement for hypertension and diabetes. However, there is limited evidence on the effects of FCP on the osteoblast function in contrast to evidence of the effects on wound healing, diabetes and bone regeneration, which have been obtained from animal studies. In this narrative review, we expound on the availability of FCP by basic research using osteoblasts. Low-concentration FCP upregulates the expression of osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen modifying enzyme-related genes. Furthermore, it could accelerate matrix mineralization. FCP may have potential utility as a biomaterial to improve collagen quality and promote mineralization through the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Smad cascades. However, there are few clinical studies on bone regeneration in human subjects. It is desirable to be applied clinically through clinical study as soon as possible, based on the results from basic research.",10.4012/dmj.2020-446,"Yamada, Shizuka"," Yamamoto, Kohei"," Nakazono, Ayako"," Matsuura, Takashi"," Yoshimura, Atsutoshi",,,,,,,,,,,

MS has received a growing concern due to its rising prevalence in many countries. The consumption of high-calorie food, sedentary lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and stress conditions aggravate risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome. Investigations targeting the development of marine algae-based functional food products and drug candidates for attenuating MS have presently received increased attention.Scope and approach: This review delivers an overview of recent (past ten years) advancements in discovering marine algal natural products with therapeutic potential against metabolic syndrome. Pathophysiology of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the action mechanisms of algal natural products are taken into the discussion.Key findings and conclusions: Marine algae, a popular ingredient in East Asian cuisine, is proven to be a source of nutritional and biofunctional natural products with promising ability to remedy MS. These include bioactive polyphenols, sulfated polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and peptides with vast structural diversity. Moreover, algae are rich sources of dietary fibers that decrease the absorption of excessive nutrition and increase microbial functionality in the gut.

J,METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL,1989.0,DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS OF DIETARY MARINE OIL ON CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID-METABOLISM IN NORMAL SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS WITH HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,"Recent studies indicate that marine (.omega.-3) fatty acids decrease hypertriglyceridemia but worsen hyperglycemia in diabetes. We studied dose-response relationships between .omega.-3 intake and indices of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 21 hypertriglyceridemic patients with (n = 6) or without (n = 15) diabetes, and 6 normal volunteers. All subjects consumed isocaloric diets of 65% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 15% protein. The basal diet contained 15% of total calories as vegetable oil (.omega.-6), and the test diets included 15%, 75%, or 3.75% calories as fish oil (MaxEPA). After three months of the basal diet, patients were randomized to receive two 3-month .omega.-3 diets in the following sequences: 15%/7.5%, 7.5%/15%, 7.5%/3.75%, or 3.75%/7.5%. Both 15% and 7.5% diets, regardless of sequence, significantly decreased serum triglycerides but increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels as much as 98% and the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio as much as 1.6-fold. Daily insulin requirements of three diabetic patients increased progressively while they received an .omega.-3-enriched diet for up to 2 years. In healthy controls, favorable changes induced by an .omega.-3 fatty acid diet in serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated with a tendency toward an inhibition of C-peptide secretion following a meal challenge. We conclude that substitution of commercially available .omega.-3 for .omega.-6 fatty acids improves hypertriglyceridemia but may worsen other lipoprotein indices and may increase insulin requirements in diabetic hypertriglyceridemic subjects.",10.1016/0026-0495(89)90004-8,"STACPOOLE, PW"," ALIG, J"," AMMON, L"," CROCKETT, SE",,,,,,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2024.0,Effects of Marine-Derived Components on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and Gut Microbiota Diversity,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which comprise coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, collectively represent the number one cause of death globally. Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human inflammatory disease. In detail, we summarise the impact of fish-derived proteins/peptides and algae components on CVD risk factors and gut microbiome.

J,NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY,2025.0,Marine-derived bioactive compounds for neuropathic pain: pharmacology and therapeutic potential,"Neuropathic pain, a challenging condition often associated with diabetes, trauma, or chemotherapy, impairs patients' quality of life. Current treatments often provide inconsistent relief and notable adverse effects, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review investigates marine-derived bioactive compounds as potential novel therapies for neuropathic pain management. Marine organisms, including fungi, algae, cone snails, sponges, soft corals, tunicates, and fish, produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites with significant pharmacological properties. These include peptides (e.g., conopeptides, piscidin 1), non-peptides (e.g., guanidinium toxins, astaxanthin, docosahexaenoic acid, fucoidan, apigenin, fumagillin, aaptamine, flexibilide, excavatolide B, capnellenes, austrasulfones, lemnalol), and crude extracts (e.g., Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella salina, Cliothosa aurivilli). These compounds exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, such as modulating ion channels (e.g., transient receptor potential channels, voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, and G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels), interacting with cell-surface receptors (e.g., nicotinic acetylcholine, NMDA, kainate, GABAB, and neurotensin receptors), inhibiting norepinephrine transporters, reducing oxidative stress, and attenuating neuroinflammation. These effects collectively contribute to alleviating nerve degeneration and symptoms of neuropathic pain, including hyperalgesia, allodynia, and associated psychomotor disturbances. Marine-derived bioactive compounds represent promising alternatives to conventional neuropathic pain treatments, to advance their development and assess their integration into neuropathic pain management strategies.",10.1007/s00210-024-03667-7,"Mishra, Swapnil"," Mishra, Yogesh"," Kumar, Ashutosh",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore we have investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide new drugs for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We have been searching for new types of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi. This review presents their structural diversities and unique biological properties. (2) In the course of our studies on the induced production of new fungal metabolites, the Palauan marine-derived fungus, Trichoderma cf. brevicompactum TPU199, was found to produce the unusual epipolythiodiketopiperazines, gliovirin and pretrichodermamide A. Long-term static fermentation of the strain induced production of a new dipeptide, dithioaspergillazine A, whereas fermentation of the strain with NaCl, NaBr, and NaI produced the Cl and Br derivatives of pretrichodermamide A and a new iodinated derivative, iododithiobrevamide, respectively. Moreover, DMSO-added seawater medium induced the production of diketopiperazine with the unprecedented trithio-bridge, chlorotrithiobrevamide.

Method Study population consisted of 200 type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension and 50 healthy subjects, all of whom were randomly assigned to MCPs-treated diabetics (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics (n=50), MCPs-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), and healthy controls (n=50). MCPs or placebo (water-soluble starch) were given daily before breakfast and bedtime over three months. Levels of free fatty acid, cytochrome P450, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, bradykinin, NO, and Prostacyclin were determined before intervention, and 1.5 months, and 3 months after intervention. Hypoglycemia and the endpoint events during the study were recorded and compared among the study groups. Result At the end of the study period, MCPs-treated patients showed marked improvement compared with patients receiving placebo. The protection exerted by MCPs seemed more profound in diabetics than in diabetics with hypertension. In particular, after MCPs intervention, levels of free fatty acid, hs-CRP, resistin, Prostacyclin decreased significantly in diabetics and tended to decrease in diabetic and hypertensive patients whereas levels of cytochrome P450, leptin, NO tended to decrease in diabetics with/without hypertension. Meanwhile, levels of adiponectin and bradykinin rose markedly in diabetics following MCPs administration. Conclusion MCPs could offer protection against diabetes and hypertension by affecting levels of molecules involved in diabetic and hypertensive pathogenesis. Regulation on metabolic nuclear receptors by MCPs may be the possible underlying mechanism for its observed effects in the study. Further study into its action may shed light on development of new drugs based on bioactive peptides from marine sources.",10.1016/S0895-3988(10)60040-2,"Zhu, Cui-Feng"," Li, Guan-Zhi"," Peng, Hong-Bin"," Zhang, Fan"," Chen, Yun"," Li, Yong",,,,,,,,,,
J,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS,2021.0,In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of Palmaria palmata Derived Peptides on Glucose Metabolism,"Three synthetic peptides, ILAP, LLAP and MAGVDHI, derived from a Palmaria palmata protein hydrolysate were assessed for their antidiabetic potential in vitro and in vivo. In addition to inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-IV in a cell-based in situ assay all three peptides significantly increased the half-life of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). ILAP and LLAP mediated a significant increase (p < 0.001) in insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 cells compared to the glucose control, while MAGVDHI had no insulinotropic activity at an eqimolar concentration (10(-6) M). A significant increase in the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in BRIN-BD11 cells mediated by ILAP (p < 0.001) and LLAP (p < 0.01) compared to the basal control, would indicate that insulin secretion may be mediated by membrane based activation. Furthermore, ILAP and LLAP acted as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secretagogues, stimulating a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the concentration of GIP released from enteroendocrine STC-1 cells compared to the glucose control. When tested in vivo in healthy male NIH Swiss mice, ILAP and LLAP, mediated a significant increase (p < 0.01) in plasma insulin and decrease (p < 0.05) in blood glucose, respectively, compared to the control. MAGVDHI mediated a significant (p < 0.001) sustained reduction in food intake in food deprived trained mice.

J,NUTRITION & DIABETES,2014.0,Fatty fish consumption and risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults,"OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that intake of fatty fish may protect against both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hypotheses rest on the high marine omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) and vitamin D contents, with possible beneficial effects on immune function and glucose metabolism. Our aim was to investigate, for the first time, fatty fish consumption in relation to the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).METHODS: Analyses were based on data from a Swedish case-control study with incident cases of LADA (n = 89) and type 2 diabetes (n = 462) and randomly selected diabetes-free controls (n = 1007). Diabetes classification was based on the onset of age (>= 35), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and C-peptide. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to derive information on previous intake of fish, polyunsaturated long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and supplementation of fish oil and vitamin D. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, education, and consumption of alcohol, fruit, vegetables and red meat.RESULTS: Weekly fatty fish consumption (>= 1 vs <1 serving per week), was associated with a reduced risk of LADA but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87, and 1.01, 95% CI 0.74-1.39, respectively). Similar associations were seen for estimated intake of n-3 PUFA (>= 0.3 g per day; LADA: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.03, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.58) and fish oil supplementation (LADA: OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.19-1.12, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.31).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fatty fish consumption may reduce the risk of LADA, possibly through effects of marine-originated omega-3 fatty acids.",10.1038/nutd.2014.36,"Lofvenborg, J.

J,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY,2015.0,Anti-diabetic potential of selected Malaysian seaweeds,"The emergence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as the pre-eminent global non-infectious disease has driven the search for new anti-diabetic strategies including utilising traditional food and herbs. In this investigation, we describe the anti-diabetic potential of six selected Malaysian seaweed species against recognised pharmacological targets. Specifically, we measured their ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and also their ability to stimulate incretin hormone secretion in vitro. Crude water extracts of Halimeda macroloba, Padina sulcata, Sargassum binderi and Turbinaria conoides possessed potent inhibitory activities against alpha-glucosidase and DPP-4. The highest inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase was found in water extracts of the green seaweed species H. macroloba with an IC50 value of 6.388 mg mL(-1). Crude water extracts of the brown seaweeds studied namely P. sulcata, S. binderi and T. conoides, exhibited potent DPP-4 inhibition compared with the green seaweed H. macroloba. The brown seaweed also stimulates secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from pGIP neo STC-1 cells in vitro. H. macroloba stimulated GLP-1 secretion but not secretion of GIP.",10.1007/s10811-014-0462-8,"Chin, Yao Xian"," Lim, Phaik Eem"," Maggs, Christine A."," Phang, Siew Moi"," Sharifuddin, Yusrizam"," Green, Brian D.",,,,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2020.0,Seaweed Secondary Metabolites with Beneficial Health Effects: An Overview of Successes in In Vivo Studies and Clinical Trials,"Macroalgae are increasingly viewed as a source of secondary metabolites with great potential for the development of new drugs. In this development, in vitro studies are only the first step in a long process, while in vivo studies and clinical trials are the most revealing stages of the true potential and limitations that a given metabolite may have as a new drug. This literature review aims to give a critical overview of the secondary metabolites that reveal the most interesting results in these two steps. Phlorotannins show great pharmaceutical potential in in vivo models and, among the several examples, the anti-dyslipidemia activity of dieckol must be highlighted because it was more effective than lovastatin in an in vivo model. The IRLIIVLMPILMA tridecapeptide that exhibits an in vivo level of activity similar to the hypotensive clinical drug captopril should still be stressed, as well as griffithsin which showed such stunning results over a variety of animal models and which will probably move onto clinical trials soon. Regarding clinical trials, studies with pure algal metabolites are scarce, limited to those carried out with kahalalide F and fucoxanthin. The majority of clinical trials currently aim to ascertain the effect of algae consumption, as extracts or fractions, on obesity and diabetes.",10.3390/md18010008,"Rosa, Goncalo P."," Tavares, Wilson R."," Sousa, Pedro M.

J,CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION,2020.0,Recently isolated antidiabetic hydrolysates and peptides from multiple food sources: a review,"Diabetes, a metabolic syndrome of global importance has been on a progressive rise in recent years. Several pharmacological approaches have been made, which have proved effective, but with underlying side effects. Bioactive hydrolysates (BHs) and peptides (BPs) from food sources, however, have shown the relative advantage of imparting less adverse effects. Furthermore, BHs and BPs from food have been discovered to impart their antidiabetic potentials through one or more mechanisms such as inhibition of digestive enzymes, inhibition of the antigenic enzyme Dipeptyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), decrease in blood glucose levels and increase in insulin uptake. Several plants and animal sources have been used as protein sources for the isolation of antidiabetic hydrolysates and peptides through different mechanisms and analytical techniques. This review integrates recent research information about several popular and unconventional food sources of BHs and BPs, their isolation techniques, antidiabetic effects and protein profiles. In addition, the fractionation technique(s) employed in each study and inhibition potentials of BHs and BPs are reviewed. This article is intended to supplement accessible scholarly literature and intellectual awareness on the subject of food-oriented approach for the management of diabetes.",10.1080/10408398.2018.1528206,"Kehinde, Bababode Adesegun"," Sharma, Poorva",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY,2021.0,Hippocampus kuda protein hydrolysate improves male reproductive dysfunction in diabetic rats,"The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing. This disease is associated with many complications including male reproductive dysfunctions and infertility. Seahorse ( Hippocampus kuda) is a marine teleost fish well known for its beneficial effects on the reproductive system in traditional Chinese medicine books. Recently, several studies have been shown that the enzymatic hydrolysate of seahorse has multiple pharmacological activities. This study aimed to investigate the seahorse peptide hydrolysate (SH) ameliorative effects on the diabetic-induced male reproductive dysfunction in rat models. The in vivo studies were carried out with three different doses of SH (4, 8, and 20 mg/kg) and the diabetes condition was induced by administrating with streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) and fed a 40% high-fat diet. Seahorse hydrolysate (20 mg/kg) inhibited lipid peroxidation, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and restored seminiferous tubules morphology in testis. Moreover, it improved reproductive dysfunction by increasing the level of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, sperm count, and motility. According to these results, we suggested that SH exhibited amelioration effects on the reproductive dysfunction.",10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111760,"Sudirman, Sabri"," Su, Chieh-Yu"," Tsou, David"," Lee, Meng-Chou"," Kong, Zwe-Ling",,,,,,,,,,,

The study aimed at examining the effects of MCPs on glucose and lipid metabolism in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and primary hypertension. Methods: One hundred patients with T2DM and primary hypertension and 50 healthy subjects (normal controls) were recruited for a randomized double blind study. The patients were randomized into MCPs treatment or patient control groups (n = 50 per group). Both patient controls and normal controls were given carboxymethylcellulose twice daily whereas the MCPs treatment group was given MCPs twice daily for 3 months. Blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, cytochrome P450, nitric oxide, bradykinin, prostacyclin, creatinine, uric acid and adipokines were measured at baseline, 1.5 and 3 months after treatment. All patients received regular medicines for control of hyperglycemia and hypertension. Results: Compared with patient controls, significantly reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and creatinine but increased levels of Insulin Sensitivity Index and Insulin Secretion Index were observed in patients receiving MCPs treatment. Furthermore, significantly reduced levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, free fatty acids, cytochrome P450, nitric oxide and prostacyclin but increased levels of high-density lipoprotein, bradykinin and adiponectin were detected in patients taking MCPs. Conclusions: MCPs supplement may benefit glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, renal function and hypertension management in Chinese patients with T2DM and hypertension.",10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181edfcf2,"Zhu, Cui-Feng"," Li, Guan-Zhi"," Peng, Hong-Bin"," Zhang, Fan"," Chen, Yun"," Li, Yong",,,,,,,,,,

Eighty pre-diabetic male and female adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups designated as placebo and AG-dieckol (1500 mg per day). Compared with the placebo group, the AG-dieckol group showed a significant decrease in postprandial glucose levels after 12 weeks. The AG-dieckol group also showed a significant decrease in insulin and C-peptide levels after 12 weeks, but there was no significant difference between the AG-dieckol and placebo groups. There were no significant adverse events related to the consumption of AG-dieckol, and biochemical and hematological parameters were maintained within the normal range during the intervention period. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that AG-dieckol supplementation significantly contributes to lowering postprandial hyperglycemia and in reducing insulin resistance. Furthermore, we believe that based on these results the consumption of phlorotanninrich foods such as marine algae may be useful for the treatment of diabetes.",10.1039/c4fo00940a,"Lee, Seung-Hong"," Jeon, You-Jin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,FOODS,2023.0,Fucoidan from Laminaria japonica Ameliorates Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Association with Modulation of Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in Streptozocin-Treated Mice,"Chronic diseases have been a leading cause of death worldwide, and polysaccharide supplementation is an effective therapeutic strategy for chronic diseases without adverse effects. In this study, the beneficial effect of Laminaria japonica fucoidan (LJF) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated in streptozocin-treated mice. LJF ameliorated the symptoms of T2DM in a dose-dependent manner, involving reduction in weight loss, water intake, triglyceride, blood glucose, cholesterol and free fatty acids, and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, catalase, glucagon-like peptide-1, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, LJF regulated the balance between insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity, reduced islet necrosis and beta-cell damage, and inhibited fat accumulation in T2DM mice. The protective effect of LJF on T2DM can be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolites, e.g., increases in Lactobacillus and Allobaculum. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics analysis showed that the microbiota metabolite profile was changed with LJF-induced microbiota alterations, mainly involving amino acids, glutathione, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. This study indicates that LJF can be used as a prebiotic agent for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and microbiota-related diseases.",10.3390/foods12010033,"Zhang, Chenxi"," Jia, Jinhui"," Zhang, Panpan"," Zheng, Weiyun"," Guo, Xiaoming"," Ai, Chunqing"," Song, Shuang",,,,,,,,,
J,OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH,2023.0,Quantitatively Evaluating the Relationships between Insulin Resistance and Retinal Neurodegeneration with Optical Coherence Tomography in Early Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess retinal neurodegenerative changes with optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without diabetic retinopathy (DR) and evaluate their relationships with insulin resistance (IR) and associated systemic indicators. Methods: 102 T2DM patients without DR and 48 healthy controls were included in this observational cross-sectional study. The OCT parameters of macular retinal thickness (MRT) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses were evaluated between diabetic and normal eyes. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was generated to evaluate the discrimination power of early diabetes. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed between ophthalmological parameters and T2DM-related demographic and anthropometric variables, and serum biomarkers and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores. Results: MRT and GCIPL thicknesses showed significant thinning in patients, especially in inferotemporal area. High body mass index (BMI) correlated with decreased GCIPL thicknesses and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). A negative correlation between waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and GCIPL thicknesses was also found. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) and fasting C-peptide (CP0) were associated with GCIPL thickness but only in inferotemporal region (r = 0.20, p = 0.04; r = -0.20, p = 0.05, respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that increased HOMA-IR scores independently predicted both average (beta = -0.30, p = 0.05) and inferotemporal (beta = -0.34, p = 0.03) GCIPL thinning. Conclusion: Retinal thinning in early T2DM was associated with obesity-related metabolic disorders.

J,MARINE DRUGS,2020.0,Tilapia Skin Peptides Ameliorate Diabetic Nephropathy in STZ-Induced Diabetic Rats and HG-Induced GMCs by Improving Mitochondrial Dysfunction,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major microvascular complications of diabetes, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in the kidneys of diabetic patients. Tilapia skin peptides (TSPs) are mixtures of small-molecular-weight peptides derived from tilapia skin. Rising evidence suggests that bioactive peptides from marine sources are beneficial for DN. This study aimed to investigate whether TSPs can alleviate the pathological progress in experimental DN by improving mitochondrial dysfunction through the activation of Bnip3/Nix signaling. In the current study, TSPs treatment alleviated the metabolic parameters and renal morphology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Additionally, TSPs treatment significantly activated Bnip3/Nix signaling and improved the mitochondrial morphology, reversed the over-production of mitochondrial superoxide and cellular reactive oxygen species and the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby inhibiting the expressions of fibronectin, collagen IV and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 in glomerular mesangial cells induced by high glucose. Collectively, our results suggest that TSPs show the renoprotective effect on DN by improving mitochondrial dysfunction, and they can be a potential therapeutic strategy for DN.",10.3390/md18070363,"Jin, Lin"," Zheng, Dongxiao"," Yang, Guanyu"," Li, Wei"," Yang, Huan"," Jiang, Qian"," Chen, Yongjun"," Zhang, Yingxia"," Xie, Xi",,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2015.0,A New Member of the TBC1D15 Family from Chiloscyllium plagiosum: Rab GTPase-Activating Protein Based on Rab7 as a Substrate,"APSL (active peptide from shark liver) is a hepatic stimulator cytokine from the liver of Chiloscyllium. It can effectively protect islet cells and improve complications in mice with alloxan-induced diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that the APSL sequence is present in the N-terminus of novel TBC (Tre-2, Bub2 and Cdc16) domain family, member 15 (TBC1D15) from Chiloscylliumplagiosum. This shark TBC1D15 gene, which contains an ORF of 2088 bp, was identified from a cDNA library of regenerating shark liver. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the gene is highly homologous to TBC1D15 genes from other species. Moreover, the N-terminus of shark TBC1D15 contains a motif of unknown function (DUF3548), which encompasses the APSL fragment. Rab-GAP activity analysis showed that shark TBC1D15 is a new member of the TBC1D15 family. These results demonstrated that shark TBC1D15 possesses Rab-GAP activity using Rab7 as a substrate, which is a common property of the TBC1D15 family. The involvement of APSL at the N-terminus of TBC1D15 also demonstrates that this protein might be involved in insulin signaling and may be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. The current findings pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of these proteins from marine sources.",10.3390/md13052955,"Li, Yuanyuan"," Wang, Weidong"," Cheng, Dandan"," Wang, Tao"," Lu, Conger"," Chen, Jian"," Nie, Zuoming"," Zhang, Wenping"," Lv, Zhengbing"," Wu, Wutong"," Shu, Jianhong",,,,,
J,METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL,2009.0,"Addition of n-3 fatty acids to a 4-hour lipid infusion does not affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or markers of oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus","Fatty acids (FA) can impair glucose metabolism to a varying degree depending on time of exposure and also of type of FA. Here we tested for acute effects of marine n-3 FA on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A 4-hour lipid infusion (Intralipid [Fresenius Kabi, Halden, Norway], total of 384 mL) was compared with a similar lipid infusion partly replaced by Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi) that contributed a median of 0.1 g fish oil per kilogram body weight, amounting to 0.04 g/kg of marine n-3 FA. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps; insulin secretion (measured after the clamps), by C-peptide glucagon tests; and energy metabolism, by indirect calorimetry. Infusion of Omegaven increased the proportion of n-3 FA in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) compared with Intralipid alone (20:5n-3: median, 1.5% [interquartile range, 0.6%] vs -0.2% [0.2%], P = .001; 22:6n-3: 0.8% [0.4%] vs -0.7% [0.2%], P = .001). However, glucose utilization was not affected; neither was insulin secretion or total energy production (P = .966, .210, and .423, respectively, for the differences between the lipid clamps). Omegaven tended to lower oxidation of fat (P = .062) compared with Intralipid only, correlating with the rise in individual n-3 NEFA (r = 0.627, P = .039). The effects of clamping on phospholipid FA composition, leptin, adiponectin, or F-2-isoprostane concentrations were not affected by Omegaven. Enrichment of NEFA with n-3 FA during a 4-hour infusion of Intralipid failed to affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or markers of oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

J,THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS,2019.0,Computational prediction of bioactivity scores and chemical reactivity properties of the Parasin I therapeutic peptide of marine origin through the calculation of global and local conceptual DFT descriptors,"Eight density functionals, CAM-B3LYP, LC-PBE, M11, MN12SX, N12SX, B97, B97X, and B97XD, related to the Def2TZVP basis sets, were assessed together with the SMD solvation model for the calculation of the molecular properties and structure of the therapeutic peptide of marine origin Parasin I. All the chemical reactivity descriptors for the system are calculated via conceptual density functional theory (CDFT). The active sites suitable for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical attacks are selected by linking them with the Fukui function indices, nucleophilic and electrophilic Parr functions, and condensed dual descriptor f(r), respectively. The study reveals that the MN12SX and N12SX density functionals are the most appropriate ones for predicting the chemical reactivity of the molecule under study. Additionally, the pKa value for the peptide is predicted with great accuracy based on our previously published methodology. Moreover, the ability of the studied molecule in acting as an efficient inhibitor of the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), which constitutes a useful knowledge for the development of drugs for fighting diabetes, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases is also presented.

J,MARINE DRUGS,2012.0,Marine Bioactives: Pharmacological Properties and Potential Applications against Inflammatory Diseases,"Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.",10.3390/md10040812,"D'Orazio, Nicolantonio"," Gammone, Maria Alessandra"," Gemello, Eugenio"," De Girolamo, Massimo"," Cusenza, Salvatore"," Riccioni, Graziano",,,,,,,,,,

In this study, four proteolytic enzymes (pepsin, neutrase, alcalase and trypsin) were used to investigate the in vitro alpha-amylase inhibition of dried laver seaweed (Porphyra species) protein hydrolysates. Pepsin hydrolysate showed effective inhibition rate at an IC50 value of 1.86 mg/mL protein as compared to other enzyme hydrolysate. This hydrolysate was fractionated in to three groups in molecular weight (MW) cutoff of 5 and 10 kDa (MW<5kDa, MW = 5-10kDa and MW>10kDa). The MW<5kDa showed better inhibition rate with IC50 value of 1.18mg/mL. This fraction (MW<5kDa) was further separated to three fractions (F-I, F-II & F-III) using gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25. F-III achieved higher alpha-amylase inhibition at an IC50 value of 0.87mg/mL. The MW distribution of F-III showed the smallest MW fractions of 90-1000Da. It can be concluded that pepsin hydrolysate of seaweed protein demonstrated a high potential in inhibiting a alpha-amylase activity, and thus, could be used as an ingredient for development of functional foods having anti-hyperglycaemic effect.",10.4194/1303-2712-v18_4_06,"Admassu, Habtamu"," Gasmalla, Mohammed Abdalbasit A."," Yang, Ruijin"," Zhao, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies highlight the therapeutic potential of algae-derived peptides in mitigating these conditions. These bioactive peptides exert anti-obesity effects by enhancing PPAR-gamma activity, reducing white adipose tissue (WAT), and regulating malonylCoA synthesis in hepatocytes, which is essential for lipid metabolism. Additionally, they activate the AMPK pathway, promoting GLUT-4 translocation and improving insulin sensitivity, thereby reducing the risk of type II diabetes. In terms of cardiovascular health, algae peptides demonstrate potent anti-hypertensive properties by inhibiting renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), thereby modulating the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) and kallikrein-kinin system (KKS).

J,CARDIOVASCULAR DIABETOLOGY,2024.0,Biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis and incident type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: results from the Vitamin D and Omega-3 trial,"BackgroundDysglycemia and insulin resistance increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet associations with specific glucose-insulin homeostatic biomarkers have been inconsistent. Vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may improve insulin resistance. We sought to examine the association between baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and a novel insulin resistance score (IRS) with incident cardiometabolic diseases, and whether randomized vitamin D or n-3 FA modify these associations.MethodsVITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (NCT01169259) was a randomized clinical trial testing vitamin D and n-3 FA for the prevention of CVD and cancer over a median of 5.3 years. Incident cases of T2D and CVD (including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) were matched 1:1 on age, sex, and fasting status to controls. Conditional logistic regressions adjusted for demographic, clinical, and adiposity-related factors were used to assess the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per-standard deviation (SD) and 95%CI of baseline insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and IRS (Insulinx0.0295 + C-peptidex0.00372) with risk of T2D, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD).ResultsWe identified 218 T2D case-control pairs and 715 CVD case-control pairs including 423 with incident CHD. Each of the four biomarkers at baseline was separately associated with incident T2D, aOR (95%CI) per SD increment: insulin 1.46 (1.03, 2.06), C-peptide 2.04 (1.35, 3.09), IRS 1.72 (1.28, 2.31) and HbA1c 7.00 (3.76, 13.02), though only HbA1c remained statistically significant with mutual adjustments. For cardiovascular diseases, we only observed significant associations of HbA1c with CVD (1.19 [1.02, 1.39]), and IRS with CHD (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]), which persisted after mutual adjustment. Randomization to vitamin D and/or n-3 FA did not modify the association of these biomarkers with the endpoints.ConclusionsEach of insulin, C-peptide, IRS, and HbA1c were associated with incident T2D with the strongest association noted for HbA1c. While HbA1c was significantly associated with CVD risk, a novel IRS appears to be associated with CHD risk. Neither vitamin D nor n-3 FA modified the associations between these biomarkers and cardiometabolic outcomes.",10.1186/s12933-024-02470-1,"Qian, Frank"," Guo, Yanjun"," Li, Chunying"," Liu, Yanyan"," Luttmann-Gibson, Heike"," Gomelskaya, Natalya"," Demler, Olga V."," Cook, Nancy R."," Lee, I-Min"," Buring, Julie E."," Larsen, Julia"," Boring, Jennifer"," McPhaul, Michael J."," Manson, JoAnn E."," Pradhan, Aruna D."," Mora, Samia"
J,DIABETOLOGIA,2015.0,Polyphenol-rich diets improve glucose metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk: a controlled randomised intervention trial,"Aim/hypothesis Dietary polyphenols and long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. This may relate to their influence on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. We evaluated the effects of diets naturally rich in polyphenols and/or LCn3 of marine origin on glucose metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk.Methods According to a 2 x 2 factorial design, individuals with high waist circumference and at least one more component of the metabolic syndrome were recruited at the obesity outpatient clinic. Eighty-six participants were randomly assigned by MINIM software to an isoenergetic diet: (1) control, low in LCn3 and polyphenol (analysed n = 20); (2) rich in LCn3 (n = 19); (3) rich in polyphenols (n = 19); or (4) rich in LCn3 and polyphenols (n = 19). The assigned diets were known for the participants and blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after the 8 week intervention, participants underwent a 3 h OGTT and a test meal with a similar composition as the assigned diet for the evaluation of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function.Results During OGTT, polyphenols significantly reduced plasma glucose total AUC (p = 0.038) and increased early insulin secretion (p = 0.048), while LCn3 significantly reduced beta cell function (p = 0.031) (two-factor ANOVA). Moreover, polyphenols improved post-challenge oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS; p = 0.05 vs control diet by post hoc ANOVA). At test meal, LCn3 significantly reduced GLP-1 total postprandial AUC (p < 0.001; two-factor ANOVA).Conclusion/interpretation Diets naturally rich in polyphenols reduce blood glucose response, likely by increasing early insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. These effects may favourably influence diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The implications of the decrease in insulin secretion and postprandial GLP-1 observed with diets rich in marine LCn3 need further clarification.",10.1007/s00125-015-3592-x,"Bozzetto, Lutgarda"," Annuzzi, Giovanni"," Pacini, Giovanni"," Costabile, Giuseppina"," Vetrani, Claudia"," Vitale, Marilena"," Griffo, Ettore"," Giacco, Angela"," De Natale, Claudia"," Cocozza, Sara"," Della Pepa, Giuseppe"," Tura, Andrea"," Riccardi, Gabriele"," Rivellese, Angela A.",,
J,LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,2022.0,Effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on erythrocyte fatty acid composition in type 2 diabetic patients,"Background: Dietary fatty acids intake affects the composition of erythrocyte fatty acids, which is strongly correlated with glycolipid metabolism disorders. This study aimed at investigating the different effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) on the fatty acids of erythrocytes and glycolipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Methods: The randomized double-blinded trial that was performed on 180 T2DM patients. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The fish oil (FO) group was administered with FO at a dose of 3 g/day containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the perilla oil (PO) group was administered with PO at a dose of 3 g/day containing alpha-linolenic (ALA), the linseed and fish oil (LFO) group was administered with mixed linseed and fish oil at a dose of 3 g/day containing EPA, DHA and ALA. Demographic information were collected and anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid metabolism indexes, erythrocyte fatty acid composition were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA.Results: A total of 150 patients finished the trial, with 52 of them in the FO group, 50 in the PO group and 48 in the LFO group. There were significant effects of time x treatment interaction on fast blood glucose (FBG), insulin, HOMA-IR and C-peptide, TC and triglyceride (TG) levels (P < 0.001). Glucose and C-peptide in PO and LFO groups decreased significantly and serum TG in FO group significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after the intervention. Erythrocyte C22: 5 n-6, ALA, DPA, n-6/n-3 PUFA, AA/EPA levels in the PO group were significantly higher than FO and LFO groups, while EPA, total n-3 PUFA and Omega-3 index were significantly higher in the FO and LFO groups compared to PO group.Conclusion: Supplementation with perilla oil decreased FBG while fish oil supplementation decreased the TG level.

J,MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH,2022.0,Green Alga Enteromorpha prolifera Oligosaccharide Ameliorates Ageing and Hyperglycemia through Gut-Brain Axis in Age-Matched Diabetic Mice,"Scope To investigate the anti-ageing and anti-diabetic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera oligosaccharide (EPO) in age-matched streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. Methods and Results LC-MS metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing is used to identify the brain metabolites and gut microbiota, respectively. EPO could significantly improve glucose metabolism and activity of total superoxide dismutase in serum. It also could regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, arginine, and inosine-related metabolic pathways in the brain of aged diabetic mice. Inosine is found to enhance the relative expressions of daf-2, daf-16, and skn-1 in insulin-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, EPO could alter the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in mice. It could upregulate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3/Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1)/B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) pathways in the brain and the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)/FOXO1/Bcl-6 signaling axis in the intestine to regulate glucose metabolite status and ageing in mice. EPO could also improve the levels of glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP1) expression in the gut, thereby inducing high expression of GLP1 receptor in the brain to control glucose metabolites through the brain-gut axis. Enterococcus is negatively correlated with AMP in the brain and could be a potential hallmark species in age-related diabetes. Conclusions These results suggest that EPO could be a potential novel natural drug for the treatment of diabetes in the elderly.",10.1002/mnfr.202100564,"Ouyang, Yuezhen"," Liu, Dan"," Zhang, Lizhu"," Li, Xiaoqing"," Chen, Xinhua"," Zhao, Chao",,,,,,,,,,
J,CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION,2016.0,Recent Research in Antihypertensive Activity of Food Protein-derived Hydrolyzates and Peptides,"Year to year obesity prevalence, reduced physical activities, bad habits/or stressful lifestyle, and other environmental and physiological impacts lead to increase in diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension worldwide. Hypertension is considered as one of the most common serious chronic diseases; however, discovery of medications with high efficacy and without side effects for treatment of patients remains a challenge for scientists. Recent trends in functional foods have evidenced that food bioactive proteins play a major role in the concepts of illness and curing; therefore, nutritionists, biomedical scientists, and food scientists are working together to develop improved systems for the discovery of peptides with increased potency and therapeutic benefits. This review presents a recent research carried out to date for the purpose of isolation and identification of bioactive hydrolyzates and peptides with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity and antihypertensive effect from animal, marine, microbial, and plant food proteins.

J,NUTRIENTS,2024.0,Bioactive Peptides from Meretrix lusoria Enzymatic Hydrolysate as a Potential Treatment for Obesity in db/db Mice,"Obesity is acknowledged as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, often accompanied by increased inflammation and diabetes. Bioactive peptides derived from marine animal proteins show promise as safe and effective anti-obesity agents by regulating adipocyte differentiation through the AMPK signaling pathway. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of bioactive compounds derived from a Meretrix lusoria Protamex enzymatic hydrolysate (MLP) fraction (<= 1 kDa) through a 6-week treatment (150 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg, administered once daily) in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. The MLP treatment significantly decreased the body weight, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels while also exhibiting a beneficial effect on hepatic and serum marker parameters in db/db mice. A histological analysis revealed a reduction in hepatic steatosis and epididymal fat following MLP treatment. Furthermore, poor glucose tolerance was improved, and hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities were elevated in MLP-treated mice compared to db/db control mice. Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of the AMPK protein after MLP treatment. In addition, the expression of lipogenic genes decreased in db/db mice. These findings indicate that bioactive peptides, which are known to regulate blood glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and adipogenesis, could be beneficial functional food additives and pharmaceuticals.",10.3390/nu16121913,"Chilakala, Ramakrishna"," Moon, Hyeon Jeong"," Jung, Min Seouk"," Han, Jong Won"," Ko, Kang Ho"," Lee, Dong Sung"," Cheong, Sun Hee",,,,,,,,,
J,TRANSPLANTATION,2009.0,Human β-cell Precursors Mature Into Functional Insulin-producing Cells in an Immunoisolation Device: Implications for Diabetes Cell Therapies,"Background. Islet transplantation is limited by the need for chronic immunosuppression and the paucity of donor tissue. As new sources of human beta-cells are developed (e.g., stem cell-derived tissue), transplanting them in a durable device could obviate the need for immunosuppression, while also protecting the patient from any risk of tumorigenicity. Here, we studied (1) the survival and function of encapsulated human beta-cells and their progenitors and (2) the. engraftment of encapsulated murine beta-cells in allo- and autoimmune settings.Methods. Human islets and human fetal pancreatic islet-like cell clusters were encapsulated in polytetrafluorethylene devices (TheraCyte) and transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Graft survival and function was measured by immunohistochemistry, circulating human C-peptide levels, and blood glucose levels. Bioluminescent imaging was used to monitor encapsulated neonatal murine islets.Results. Encapsulated human islet-like cell clusters survived, replicated, and acquired a level of glucose responsive insulin secretion sufficient to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Bioluminescent imaging of encapsulated marine neonatal islets revealed a dynamic process of cell death followed by regrowth, resulting in robust long-term allograft survival. Further, in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes, encapsulated primary beta-cells ameliorated diabetes without stimulating a detectable T-cell response.Conclusions. We demonstrate for the first time that human beta-cells function is compatible with encapsulation in a durable, immunoprotective device. Moreover, our study suggests that encapsulation of beta-cells before terminal differentiation will be a successful approach for new cell-based therapies for diabetes, such as those derived from stem cells.",10.1097/TP.0b013e31819c86ea,"Lee, Seung-Hee"," Hao, Ergeng"," Savinov, Alexei Y."," Geron, Ifat"," Strongin, Alex Y."," Itkin-Ansari, Pamela",,,,,,,,,,
J,NUTRIENTS,2020.0,"Oligo-Fucoidan Improves Diabetes-Induced Renal Fibrosis via Activation of Sirt-1, GLP-1R, and Nrf2/HO-1: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study","Fucoidan extracted from brown algae has multiple beneficial functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of low-molecular-weight fucoidan (oligo-FO) on renal fibrosis under in vitro and in vivo diabetic conditions, and its molecular mechanisms. Advanced glycation product (AGE)-stimulated rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) and diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and nicotinamide were used. Oligo-FO treatment significantly inhibited anti-high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/RAGE/ anti-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)/transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)/TGF-beta 1R/Smad 2/3/fibronectin signaling pathway and HIF-1 alpha activation in AGE-stimulated NRK-52E cells. Conversely, the expression and activity of Sirt-1; the levels of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), p-AMPK, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1); and Nrf2 activation were remarkably increased by oligo-FO in AGE-stimulated cells. However, the above effects of oligo-FO were greatly diminished by inhibiting Sirt-1, HO-1, or GLP-1R activity. Similar changes of these pro-fibrotic genes in the kidney and a marked attenuation of renal injury and dysfunction were observed in oligo-FO-treated diabetic mice. These findings indicated that the inhibitory effects of the oligo-FO on diabetes-evoked renal fibrosis are mediated by suppressing TGF-beta 1-activated pro-fibrogenic processes via Sirt-1, HO-1, and GLP-1R dependence. Collectively, fucoidan-containing foods or supplements may be potential agents for ameliorating renal diseases due to excessive fibrosis.",10.3390/nu12103068,"Yu, Wen-Chun"," Huang, Ren-Yeong"," Chou, Tz-Chong",,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,NUTRIENTS,2024.0,Food Proteins as Functional Ingredients in the Management of Chronic Diseases: A Concise Review,"Chronic diseases have emerged as a formidable global health concern, with their prevalence steadily rising over the years. Several approaches to addressing these concerns include the use of medications, which are often expensive, contain synthetic chemical substances, and have reported adverse effects. The use of foods, especially proteins, as an alternative approach to addressing chronic health concerns by treating and managing chronic diseases is increasing. This review evaluates the intriguing role of food proteins in mitigating chronic diseases and improving our understanding of the therapeutic potential of different protein types, including those derived from legumes, nuts, and seeds, dairy, fish, and numerous other sources. They have been reported to offer promising avenues for managing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic inflammation, weight management, bone health, glycemic control, muscle preservation, and many other health benefits. Although the exact mechanisms for these actions are still not properly elucidated, it is, however, understood that food proteins exert these health-beneficial effects by their unique nutritional and bioactive profiles, especially their bioactive peptides and amino acids. Practical applications are also discussed, including dietary interventions that are tailored towards incorporating protein-rich foods and the development of functional foods for disease prevention and management. Food proteins are a promising approach to combating chronic diseases that can turn around public health practices.",10.3390/nu16142323,"Shahnaz, Thaniyath"," Fawole, Abosede O."," Adeyanju, Adeyemi A."," Onuh, John O.",,,,,,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2021.0,Seaweed Components as Potential Modulators of the Gut Microbiota,"Macroalgae, or seaweeds, are a rich source of components which may exert beneficial effects on the mammalian gut microbiota through the enhancement of bacterial diversity and abundance. An imbalance of gut bacteria has been linked to the development of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, hypertension, type-2-diabetes, obesity, and cancer. This review outlines current knowledge from in vitro and in vivo studies concerning the potential therapeutic application of seaweed-derived polysaccharides, polyphenols and peptides to modulate the gut microbiota through diet. Polysaccharides such as fucoidan, laminarin, alginate, ulvan and porphyran are unique to seaweeds. Several studies have shown their potential to act as prebiotics and to positively modulate the gut microbiota. Prebiotics enhance bacterial populations and often their production of short chain fatty acids, which are the energy source for gastrointestinal epithelial cells, provide protection against pathogens, influence immunomodulation, and induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The oral bioaccessibility and bioavailability of seaweed components is also discussed, including the advantages and limitations of static and dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal models versus ex vivo and in vivo methods. Seaweed bioactives show potential for use in prevention and, in some instances, treatment of human disease. However, it is also necessary to confirm these potential, therapeutic effects in large-scale clinical trials. Where possible, we have cited information concerning these trials.",10.3390/md19070358,"Shannon, Emer"," Conlon, Michael"," Hayes, Maria",,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN,2024.0,Effect of Meroterpenoids from Sargassum macrocarpum on the Inhibition of Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation,"Amyloid polypeptide aggregation is considered one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the number of affected patients increases as the population ages. Amyloid beta (A beta) found in the brain of patients with AD and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) found in the pancreas of patients with T2D are thought to be cytotoxic during the aggregation process, especially the low-molecular-weight oligomers that are aggregation intermediates. In this study, meroterpenoids isolated and structurally determined from the brown alga Sargassum macrocarpum were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hIAPP aggregation. The results showed that 16 compounds from S. macrocarpum exhibited hIAPP aggregation-inhibitory activity, mainly through the inhibition of fiber elongation. These compounds showed higher activity with a hydroquinone moiety than with a quinone moiety, similar to their aggregation-inhibitory activity against A beta 42. Furthermore, these peptides demonstrated the potential to inhibit oligomer formation at high concentration ratios of 1 : 4 or higher. Further, compounds lacking hydroxyl groups did not exhibit this aggregation-inhibitory activity, suggesting that the phenolic hydroxyl group is essential for this activity.",10.1248/bpb.b24-00610,"Tozawa, Yuta"," Shinoda, Seiya"," Sekiguchi, Mitsuhiro"," Miyamae, Yusaku"," Shigemori, Hideyuki",,,,,,,,,,,
J,NUTRIENTS,2021.0,Edible Microalgae and Their Bioactive Compounds in the Prevention and Treatment of Metabolic Alterations,"Marine and freshwater algae and their products are in growing demand worldwide because of their nutritional and functional properties. Microalgae (unicellular algae) will constitute one of the major foods of the future for nutritional and environmental reasons. They are sources of high-quality protein and bioactive molecules with potential application in the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes. They may also contribute decisively to sustainability through carbon dioxide fixation and minimization of agricultural land use. This paper reviews current knowledge of the effects of consuming edible microalgae on the metabolic alterations known as metabolic syndrome (MS). These microalgae include Chlorella, Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Tetraselmis as well as Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis as candidates for human consumption. Chlorella biomass has shown antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects in humans and other mammals. The components of microalgae reviewed suggest that they may be effective against MS at two levels: in the early stages, to work against the development of insulin resistance (IR), and later, when pancreatic -cell function is already compromised. The active components at both stages are antioxidant scavengers and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as carotenoids and -3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid; EPA/DHA), prebiotic polysaccharides, phenolics, antihypertensive peptides, several pigments such as phycobilins and phycocyanin, and some vitamins, such as folate. As a source of high-quality protein, including an array of bioactive molecules with potential activity against the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes, microalgae are proposed as excellent foods for the future. Moreover, their incorporation into the human diet would decisively contribute to a more sustainable world because of their roles in carbon dioxide fixation and reducing the use of land for agricultural purposes.",10.3390/nu13020563,"Ramos-Romero, Sara"," Torrella, Joan Ramon"," Pages, Teresa"," Viscor, Gines"," Torres, Josep Lluis",,,,,,,,,,,
J,FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,2018.0,The Case Study of Nesfatin-1 in the Pancreas of Tursiops truncatus,"Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is an anorexigenic peptide involved in the regulation of homeostatic feeding. Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from beta-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in alpha-cells. Similar to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.",10.3389/fphys.2018.01845,"Gatta, Claudia"," De Felice, Elena"," D'Angelo, Livia"," Maruccio, Lucianna"," Leggieri, Adele"," Lucini, Carla"," Palladino, Antonio"," Paolucci, Marina"," Scocco, Paola"," Varricchio, Ettore"," de Girolamo, Paolo",,,,,
J,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,2013.0,Evidence for a new binding mode to GSK-3: Allosteric regulation by the marine compound palinurin,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) is widely recognised as a relevant player in the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3 beta inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3 beta inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GSK-3 beta. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3 beta inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In humans, enzymes that play a role in the prevention and development of MS include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-1) associated with hypertension, alpha-amylase associated with T2D, and lipase linked to the development of obesity. Seaweeds are a rich source of bioactives consisting of proteins/peptides, polysaccharides, and lipids. This study examined the potential of seaweed-derived bioactives from Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca, and Palmaria palmata as inhibitors of ACE-1, alpha-amylase, and lipase. In vitro enzyme inhibitory assays were used to quantify the bioactivity of the seaweed extracts and compare their half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) values to recognised positive control enzyme inhibitory drugs captopril (c) (an ACE-1 inhibitor), acarbose (an alpha-amylase inhibitor), and orlistat (a lipase inhibitor). Three seaweed extracts displayed enzyme inhibitory activities equal to, or more effective than, the reference positive control drugs. These were P. palmata peptides (ACE-1 IC50 94.29 +/- 3.07 mu g/mL, vs. captopril (c) 91.83 +/- 2.68 mu g/mL); A. esculenta polyphenol extract (alpha-amylase IC50 147.04 +/- 9.72 mu g/mL vs. acarbose 185.67 +/- 12.48 mu g/mL, and lipase IC50 106.21 +/- 6.53 mu g/mL vs. orlistat 139.74 +/- 9.33 mu g/mL); and U. lactuca polysaccharide extract (alpha-amylase IC50 168.06 +/- 10.53 mu g/mL vs. acarbose 185.67 +/- 12.48 mu g/mL).

The present study was focused on the effect of protein hydrolysate from smooth hound (Mustelus mustelus) (SHPH) in the regulation of components of the food intake control such as satiety. SHPH was produced by intestinal digestive proteases from the same species. The amino acid analysis by GC/MS showed that the hydrolysate was rich in leucine, alanine, glycine, threonine, serine, lysine and glutamate. The molecular weights of peptides in SHPH were estimated by ESI-MS to be between 200 and 2500 Da. Biological in vivo capacities of SHPH in rats were evaluated by determination of the CCK-like peptides and insulin content using a clinical human radioimmunoassay. The food intake and the body weight of rats were measured during the period of treatment. Rats treated with SHPH showed a significant decrease in body weight at the end of treatment, as well as a decrease of food intake.

The inhibitory activity of each seaweed extract was determined using established in vitro colorimetric methods with mammalian-derived enzymes and their respective substrates. The ACE-1 half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations of generated bioactive extracts ranged from 167.52 +/- 3.17 mu g mL(-1) (U. ohnoi PEP) to 713.84 +/- 12.45 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PS). None of the extracts screened displayed IC50 values comparable to the positive control drug Captopril (8.87 +/- 0.04 mu g mL(-1)). IC50 values determined for extracts that inhibited alpha-amylase ranged from 58.31 +/- 1.41 mu g mL(-1) (P. comosa PP) to 515.24 +/- 10.53 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PEP). All PS and PP had significantly lower IC50 values than the alpha-amylase inhibitor control, Acarbose (89.90 +/- 0.15 mu g mL(-1)). Lipase IC50 values determined for extracts ranged from 52.14 +/- 2.77 mu g mL(-1) (P. comosa PP) to 876.30 +/- 34.92 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PEP). All PP had significantly lower IC50 values than the lipase inhibitory drug Orlistat (70.83 +/- 0.07 mu g mL(-1)). To the authors' knowledge there are no published values for the inhibitory potential of P. comosa, E. radiata or U. ohnoi extracts against the enzymes ACE-1, alpha-amylase, or lipase.

J,MARINE DRUGS,2019.0,Identifying Phlorofucofuroeckol-A as a Dual Inhibitor of Amyloid-β25-35 Self-Aggregation and Insulin Glycation: Elucidation of the Molecular Mechanism of Action,"Both amyloid-beta (A beta) and insulin are amyloidogenic peptides, and they play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Misfolded or aggregated A beta and glycated insulin are commonly found in AD and T2D patients, respectively, and exhibit neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. The present study examined the anti-A beta(25-35) aggregation and anti-insulin glycation activities of five phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia stolonifera. Thioflavin-T assay results suggest that eckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFFA) significantly inhibit A beta(25-35) self-assembly. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation analyses confirmed that these phlorotannins have a strong potential to interact with A beta(25-35) peptides and interrupt their self-assembly and conformational transformation, thereby inhibiting A beta(25-35) aggregation. In addition, PFFA dose-dependently inhibited d-ribose and d-glucose induced non-enzymatic insulin glycation. To understand the molecular mechanism for insulin glycation and its inhibition, we predicted the binding site of PFFA in insulin via computational analysis. Interestingly, PFFA strongly interacted with the Phe1 in insulin chain-B, and this interaction could block d-glucose access to the glycation site of insulin. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that phlorofucofuroeckol-A could be a new scaffold for AD treatment by inhibiting the formation of beta-sheet rich structures in A beta(25-35) and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in insulin.",10.3390/md17110600,"Seong, Su Hui"," Paudel, Pradeep"," Jung, Hyun Ah"," Choi, Jae Sue",,,,,,,,,,,,
J,ENZYME AND MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY,2007.0,Screening of inhibitors of porcine dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in aqueous extracts from marine organisms,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) hydrolyses biologically active peptides that control critical functions. For example, action of glucagons-like peptide 1, an hormone that plays multiple roles in metabolic homeostasis and a potential agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is diminished by its susceptibility to DPPIV activity. The goal of this work was to the search for DPPIV inhibitory activity in the Caribbean marine fauna. The screening was done in aqueous crude extracts of species belonging to phyla Cnidaria, Mollusca, Annelida, Echinodermata, Poriphera, Chordata, Chlorophycota and Chlorophyta collected on the Northern coast of Havana (Cuba). An inhibitory activity was found in extracts of three species belonging to phyla Poriphera and Cnidaria: the sponge Xetospongia muta and the sea anemones Bunodosoma granulifera and Bartholomea annulata. The crude extracts from these species were treated with 2.5% final concentration of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or with heat (60 degrees C, 10 min). Both treatments increased inhibitory activity in X. muta but failed in B. granulifera and B. annulata extracts. Preliminary characterization indicated that in each case the effect on DPPIV activity is dose-dependent, the inhibition is slow and the molecule responsible for DPPIV inhibition has a low molecular weight. The present contribution shows that the detected species are promising sources of DPPIV natural inhibitors with potential therapeutic applications (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J,BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING,2010.0,Motif-Based Search for a Novel Fructosyl Peptide Oxidase From Genome Databases,"The measurement of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has important implications for diagnosis of diabetes and assessment of treatment effectiveness. We proposed specific sequence motifs to identify enzymes that oxidize glycated compounds from genome database searches. The gene encoding a putative fructosyl amino acid oxidase was found in the Phaeosphaeria nodorum SN15 genome and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (XP_001798711) was confirmed to be a novel fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPOX) with high specificity for a-glycated compounds, such as HbA1c model compounds fructosyl-N-alpha-valine (f-(alpha)Val) and fructosyl-N-alpha-valyl-histidine (f-(alpha)Val-His). Unlike previously reported FPOXs, the P. nodorum FPOX has a K-m value for f-(alpha)Val-His (0.185 mM) that is considerably lower than that for f-(alpha)Val (0.458 mM). Based on amino acid sequence alignment, three dimensional structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis, Gly60 was found to be a determining residue for the activity towards f-(alpha)Val-His. A flexible surface loop region was also found to likely play an important role in accepting f-(alpha)Val-His. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2010;106: 358-366.

J,VETERINARY WORLD,2024.0,Combination of curcuminoid and collagen marine peptides for healing diabetic wounds infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,"Background and Aim: The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Indonesia indirectly reflects the high risk of developing chronic wounds that are susceptible to infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an infectious pathogen that is resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, antibiotic therapy is ineffective enough to treat chronic hyperglycemic wounds caused by MRSA infection. Curcuminoids have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects by inhibiting the enzymatic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Collagen is a tissue regeneration inducer. The combination of these two ingredients is expected to be an alternative therapy for MRSA-infected hyperglycemic chronic wounds without the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hydrolacingel in wound healing and inhibiting the growth of MRSA bacteria, as well as to determine the optimal concentration of curcuminoids combined with collagen marine peptides (CMPs). Materials and Methods: Hydrolacin-gels were prepared by homogenizing curcuminoid nanoemulsions and CMPs. The evaluation of preparation includes stability tests and antibacterial activity tests. Wound diabetic mice were treated with various combinations of curcuminoid and CMPs. Wound healing was observed based on malondialdehyde levels as a marker of oxidative stress and histopathological changes in the skin wound. Results: Hydrolacin-gel was formulated by combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion (more water soluble) and CMPs, with the ratio of formula 1 (1:2, curcuminoid 43.3 mg and CMPs 5.58 mg), formula 2 (1:1, curcuminoid 86.8 mg and CMPs 3.72), and formula 3 (2:1, curcuminoid 130.2 mg and CMPs 1.87 mg) calculated based on the effective dose of curcuminoid 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) and CAMPs 0.9 g/kg BW. Hydrolacin-gel had a potential antibacterial activity against MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel induced wound tissue repair and reduced oxidative stress caused by inflammation in diabeticinfected MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel could be used for healing MRSA-infected diabetic wounds, especially formula 3 with the ratio of curcuminoid: CMPs = 2:1. Conclusion: Hydrolacin-gel combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion and CMPs effectively inhibited the inflammatory process and increased re-epithelialization in MRSA-infected diabetic wound healing. Hydrolacin-gel with curcuminoid (130.2 mg) and CMPs (1.87 mg) at a concentration ratio of 2:1 appeared to be the best formula against MRSA infection in diabetic wounds.",10.14202/vetworld.2024.933-939,"Mustofa, Dwi Ardyan Syah"," Sahari, Farhan Dio"," Pramudani, Syifa Aulia"," Hidayah, Alifia Brilliani"," Tsany, Shabrina Farras"," Salasia, Siti Isrina Oktavia",,,,,,,,,,
J,JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE,2015.0,In vitro assessment of the multifunctional bioactive potential of Alaska pollock skin collagen following simulated gastrointestinal digestion,"BACKGROUNDDietary mineral deficiency, hypertension and diabetes have become serious human health problems. Dietary approaches are increasingly being investigated to address these issues. Identification of food-derived biological peptides has become an important approach to control such diseases. Peptides generated from aquatic byproducts have been shown to possess biological activities.RESULTSSignificantly higher copper-chelating activity was observed on simulated hydrolysis of intact collagen. The collagen hydrolysate generated in the gastric stage exhibited moderate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 2.920.22mgmL(-1), which significantly decreased to 0.49 +/- 0.02mgmL(-1) after intestinal digestion. The dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV-inhibitory potency of the collagen hydrolysate generated directly following simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) (IC50 2.59 +/- 0.04mgmL(-1)) was significantly lower than that of the collagen tryptic hydrolysate (CTH) (IC50 1.53 +/- 0.01mgmL(-1)). The antioxidant activities of collagen and CTH using the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay were 0.87 +/- 0.10 and 1.27 +/- 0.03 mu mol Trolox equivalent (TE) g(-1) respectively after SGID.CONCLUSION This study identifies collagen as a good and inexpensive substrate for the generation of biologically active peptides with potential applications as functional ingredients in the management of chronic illness and mineral deficiency problems.

J,LIFE SCIENCES,2012.0,Modulation of TRPV1-dependent contractility of normal and diabetic bladder smooth muscle by analgesic toxins from sea anemone Heteractis crispa,"Aims: TRPV1-expressing, capsaicin (CAP)-sensitive afferent fibers innervating bladder in addition to sensory function also exhibit efferent features consisting in TRPV1-dependent release of tachykinins (TAC) affecting detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) contractions. Our aim was to investigate the effects of two novel polypeptide inhibitors of TRPV1 from the venom of tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa, APHC1 and APHC3, on the contractions of DSM from bladders of normal and diabetic rats.Main methods: Experiments were conducted on urothelium-devoid DSM strips from normal rats and rats 8 weeks after streptozotocin-induced diabetes by means of contraction force measurements.Key findings: Pre-exposure of DSM strips to APHC1 or APHC3 (200 nM) specifically inhibited CAP-induced, TRPV1-dependent contractions. Both peptides also transiently enhanced basal tone and spontaneous contractions of DSM strips followed by delayed suppression of electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) contractions. The decrease of the amplitude of EFS-evoked NANC contractions by APHC1 or APHC3 reached 38.5 +/- 3.4% and 25.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively, in normal DSM strips and 46.3 +/- 3.3% and 43.9 +/- 1.8%, respectively, in diabetic ones. APHC-peptide-induced transient enhancement of basal tone could be mimicked by serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride (300 mu M).Significance: Our results demonstrate that APHC1 and APHC3 may be considered as effective inhibitors of bladder contractility especially during diabetic cystopathy. Modality of action of APHC-polypeptides via the mechanisms involving decreased TRPV1-dependent release of TAC from bladder afferents and suppression of TAC degradation due to their activity as endogenous proteases inhibitors is proposed.

J,MARINE DRUGS,2019.0,Antihypertensive and Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme (ACE)-Inhibitory Peptides from Fish as Potential Cardioprotective Compounds,"The term metabolic/cardiometabolic/insulin resistance syndrome could generally be defined as the co-occurrence of several risk factors inclusive of systemic arterial hypertension. Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides. Furthermore, drug-likeness of selected biopeptides was predicted by Lipinski's rules to differentiate a drug-like biopeptide from nondrug-like one.",10.3390/md17110613,"Abachi, Soheila"," Bazinet, Laurent"," Beaulieu, Lucie",,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,3 BIOTECH,2023.0,A comprehensive review on algal nutraceuticals as prospective therapeutic agent for different diseases,"Ongoing research in the food supplement sector provides insightful information regarding algae as a new-generation nutritional supplement and is also referred to as a superfood. Due to the diverse nutritional components, algae have documented numerous health benefits like fighting microbial diseases, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, algae-derived nutraceuticals account for a rapidly expanding market in the food supplements sector. The concept of algal prebiotics and their role in modulating gut microbiota have also been a chief contributor to this. This review evaluates the use of possible algal species and their specific bioactive compounds for the management of several chronic diseases. Proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, phenolics, and vitamins give an insight into the significance of algae in boosting the immune system and improving the body's nutritional makeup. In addition, phyco-compounds such as polysaccharides and polyphenols are also receiving a lot more interest in cosmeceutical applications for protecting skin from photodamage. The incorporation of algae in the diet for the management and prevention of chronic diseases like cancer, lung, and heart disease has been discussed in this review along with their action mechanism. This review provides a brief overview of several bioactive compounds present in micro and macroalgae and their therapeutic effect on lifestyle diseases, gastrointestinal diseases as well as neurodegenerative diseases.",10.1007/s13205-022-03454-2,"Kumari, Asmita", Garima," Bharadvaja, Navneeta",,,,,,,,,,,,,
S,AQUACULTURE AND BY-PRODUCTS: Challenges and Opportunities in the Use of Alternative Protein Sources and Bioactive Compounds,2020.0,Aquaculture and by-products: Challenges and opportunities in the use of alternative protein sources and bioactive compounds,"There is a growing concern about chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and cardiovascular diseases resulting from profound changes in the western lifestyle. Aquaculture by-products are generated in large quantities and they can be profitably recycled through their bioactive compounds used for health or food supplements. Improving waste utilization in the field of aquaculture is essential for a sustainable industry to prevent or minimize the environmental impact. In this sense fish by-products are a great source of protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are particularly studied on Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout. Fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) obtained from chemical, enzymatical and microbial hydrolysis of processing by-products are being used as a source of amino acids and peptides with high digestibility, fast absorption and important biological activities. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) from fish discards have been reported to decrease postprandial triacylglycerol levels, reduction of blood pressure, platelet aggregation and the inflammatory response. Crustacean by-products can also be used to produce chitosan with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity for food and pharmaceutical industries and carotenoids with important biological activity. Seaweeds are rich in bioactive compounds such as alginate, carrageenan, agar, carotenoids and polyphenols with different biological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, regarding harvest microalgae, during the past decades, they were mainly used in the healthy food market, with >75% of the annual microalgal biomass production, used for the manufacture of powders, tablets, capsules or pills. We will report and discuss the present and future role of aquaculture by-products as sources of biomolecules for the design and development of functional foods/beverages. This chapter will focus on the main bioactive compounds from aquaculture by-products as functional compounds in food and their applications in biomedicine for the prevention and treatment of diseases.",10.1016/bs.afnr.2019.11.001,"Lopez-Pedrouso, Maria"," Lorenzo, Josee M."," Cantalapiedra, Jesus"," Zapata, Carlos"," Franco, Jose M."," Franco, Daniel",,,,,,,,,,
J,CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL,2024.0,Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti-Obesity Cyclic Peptide,"Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein-protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.Stylissatin A and its analogs are shown to inhibit the interaction between mature protective protein cathepsin A and neuraminidase 1 in lysosomes, which caused irregular proteolysis of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes. This PPI-modulating effect is promising to develop anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity drug leads. image",10.1002/chem.202402049,"Sun, Yiting"," Dakiiwa, Ayumi"," Zhang, Menghua"," Shibata, Takahiro"," Kita, Masaki",,,,,,,,,,,

J,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,2024.0,Process optimization and characterization of hydrolysate from underutilized brown macroalgae (Padina tetrastromatica) after fucoidan extraction through subcritical water hydrolysis,"The growing demand for macroalgal biomass as a source of proteins, peptides, and amino acids is garnering attention for their biological and functional properties. This study depicts the use of emerging green techniques, i.e. subcritical water, to hydrolyze protein from Padina tetrastromatica. The biomass was treated with subcritical water at varying temperatures between 100 and 220 degrees C for 10-40 min at a biomass to water proportion of 1:50 (w/v) and pressure of 4.0 MPa. The optimum conditions for recovering the maximum protein (127.2 +/- 1.1 mg g(-1)), free amino acids (58.4 +/- 1.0 mg g(-1)), highest degree of hydrolysis (58.8 +/- 1.2 %) and low molecular weight peptides (<650 Da) were found to be 220 degrees C for 10 min. The amino acid profiling of the hydrolysate revealed that it contains 45 % essential amino acids, with the highest concentration of methionine (0.18 %), isoleucine (0.12 %) and leucine (0.10 %). It was found that the hydrolysate contains phenolics (23.9 +/- 1.4 mg GAE g(-1)) and flavonoids (1.23 +/- 0.1 mg QE g(-1)), which are largely responsible for antioxidant activity. The hydrolysate effectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase and alpha-amylase in vitro, with IC50 values of 17.9 +/- 0.1 mg mL(-1) and 16.0 +/- 0.5 %, respectively, which can help prevent Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. Consequently, this study reveals that utilizing eco-friendly subcritical water hydrolysis method, 79 % of the protein was recovered from P. tetrastromatica, which might be an effective source of bioactive peptides in various nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119497,"Hans, Nidhi"," Solanki, Divyang"," Nagpal, Tanya"," Amir, Hirah"," Naik, Satyanarayan"," Malik, Anushree",,,,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2023.0,Astaxanthin: A Marine Drug That Ameliorates Cerebrovascular-Damage-Associated Alzheimer's Disease in a Zebrafish Model via the Inhibition of Matrix Metalloprotease-13,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major type of dementia disorder. Common cognitive changes occur as a result of cerebrovascular damage (CVD) via the disruption of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). In diabetic cases, the progress of vascular dementia is faster and the AD rate is higher. Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to have a higher risk of the factor for AD progression. Hence, this study is designed to investigate the role of astaxanthin (AST) in CVD-associated AD in zebrafish via the inhibition of MMP-13 activity. CVD was developed through the intraperitoneal and intracerebral injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The AST (10 and 20 mg/L), donepezil (1 mg/L), and MMP-13 inhibitor (i.e., CL-82198; 10 mu M) were exposed for 21 consecutive days in CVD animals. The cognitive changes in zebrafish were evaluated through light and dark chamber tests, a color recognition test, and a T-maze test. The biomarkers of AD pathology were assessed via the estimation of the cerebral extravasation of Evans blue, tissue nitrite, amyloid beta-peptide aggregation, MMP13 activity, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The results revealed that exposure to AST leads to ameliorative behavioral and biochemical changes. Hence, AST can be used for the management of AD due to its multi-targeted actions, including MMP-13 inhibition.",10.3390/md21080433,"Paramakrishnan, Nallupillai"," Lim, Khian Giap"," Paramaswaran, Yamunna"," Ali, Nemat"," Waseem, Mohammad"," Shazly, Gamal A."," Bin Jardan, Yousef A."," Muthuraman, Arunachalam",,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2022.0,An Octopus-Derived Peptide with Antidiuretic Activity in Rats,"Discovering new drug candidates with high efficacy and few side effects is a major challenge in new drug development. The two evolutionarily related peptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to be associated with a variety of physiological and psychological processes via the association of OXT with three types of AVP receptors. Over decades, many synthetic analogs of these peptides have been designed and tested for therapeutic applications; however, only a few studies of their natural analogs have been performed. In this study, we investigated the bioactivity and usefulness of two natural OXT/AVP analogs that originate from the marine invertebrate Octopus vulgaris, named octopressin (OTP) and cephalotocin (CPT). By measuring the intracellular Ca2+ or cyclic AMP increase in each OXT/AVP receptor subtype-overexpressing cell, we found that CPT, but not OTP, acts as a selective agonist of human AVP type 1b and 2 receptors. This behavior is reminiscent of desmopressin, the most widely prescribed antidiuretic drug in the world. Similar to the case for desmopressin, a single intravenous tail injection of CPT into Sprague-Dawley rats reduced urine output and increased urinary osmolality. In conclusion, we suggest that CPT has a significant antidiuretic effect and that CPT might be beneficial for treating urological conditions such as nocturia, enuresis, and diabetes insipidus.",10.3390/md20050328,"Kim, Ye-Ji"," Lee, Jei Ha"," Jung, Seung-Hyun"," Kim, Ki Hyun"," Choi, Chang-Hoon"," Jo, Seonmi"," Woo, Dong Ho",,,,,,,,,

J,JOURNAL OF NUTRITION,2016.0,Lean Seafood Intake Reduces Postprandial C-peptide and Lactate Concentrations in Healthy Adults in a Randomized Controlled Trial with a Crossover Design,"Background: Recently we showed that lean seafood consumption reduced circulating triacylglycerol (TG) and VLDL concentrations and prevented an elevated total-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio relative to intake of a nonseafood diet.Objective: We aimed to elucidate whether diet-induced altered carbohydrate metabolism could be a contributing factor to the previously observed different lipoprotein patterns.Methods: This was a secondary outcome and explorative randomized controlled trial with a crossover design in 20 healthy adults (7 men and 13 women) that were 50.6 +/- 3.4 (mean +/- SEM) y old, weighed 75.7 +/- 2.5 kg, and had a body mass index (BM I, in kg/m(2)) of 25.6 +/- 0.7. After a 3-wk run-in period and separated by a 5-wk wash-out period, the participants consumed 2 balanced diets [in percentage of energy (energy%); 29% fat, 52% carbohydrates, 19% protein] for 4 wk. The diets varied in the main protein sources; 60 energy% of total protein was from either lean seafood or nonseafood sources. On the first and last day of each diet period, fasting and postprandial blood samples were collected before and after consumption of test meals (in energy%; 28% fat, 52% carbohydrates, 20% protein) with cod or lean beef.Results: The diets did not alter serum insulin and glucose concentrations. However, relative to the nonseafood diet period, the lean seafood diet period reduced postprandial C-peptide (P = 0.04) and lactate (P = 0.012) concentrations and fasting and postprandial TG/HDL-cholesterol ratios (P = 0.002). Hence, different postprandial lactate levels occurred at equal glucose concentrations.Conclusions: Even though the diets did not alter serum insulin and glucose concentrations, intake of the lean seafood compared with the nonseafood diet reduced postprandial concentrations of C-peptide and lactate and the TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio in healthy adults in a manner that may affect the long-term development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",10.3945/jn.115.229278,"Aadland, Eli K."," Graff, Ingvild E."," Lavigne, Charles"," Eng, Oyvin"," Paquette, Martine"," Holthe, Asle"," Mellgren, Gunnar"," Madsen, Lise"," Jacques, Helene"," Liaset, Bjorn",,,,,,
J,JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE,2015.0,Functional components and medicinal properties of food: a review,"Research has proved a relationship between functional components of food, health and well-being. Thus, functional components of food can be effectively applied in the treatment and prevention of diseases. They act simultaneously at different or identical target sites with the potential to impart physiological benefits and promotion of wellbeing including reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, inflammation, type II diabetes, and other chronic degenerative diseases, lowering of blood cholesterol, neutralization of reactive oxygen species and charged radicals, anticarcinogenic effect, low-glycaemic response, etc. Previously, it was thought that functional ingredients such as non-starchy carbohydrates including soluble and insoluble dietary fibres, fucoidan; antioxidants including polyphenols, carotenoids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, phytosterols, isoflavones, organosulphur compounds; plant sterols and soy phytoestrogens occur only in plant foods (whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) as phytochemicals. However, probiotics, prebiotics, conjugated linolenic acid, long-chain omega-3, -6 and -9-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and bioactive peptides have proved that functional components are equally available in animal products such as milk, fermented milk products and cold-water fish. The way a food is processed affects its functional components. Many processing techniques have been found to lower the concentration of functional components in food. Conversely, other techniques were found to increase them. Hence, in a time when the role of a healthy diet in preventing non-communicable diseases is well accepted, the borderline between food and medicine is becoming very thin.",10.1007/s13197-014-1396-5,"Abuajah, Christian Izuchukwu"," Ogbonna, Augustine Chima"," Osuji, Chijioke Maduka",,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,MARINE DRUGS,2022.0,Marginal Impact of Brown Seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus Extract on Metabolic and Inflammatory Response in Overweight and Obese Prediabetic Subjects,"The objective of the present study was to test whether a brown seaweed extract rich in polyphenols combined with a low-calorie diet would induce additional weight loss and improve blood glucose homeostasis in association with a metabolic and inflammatory response in overweight/obese prediabetic subjects. Fifty-six overweight/obese, dysglycemic, and insulin-resistant men and women completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and parallel clinical trial. Subjects were administrated 500 mg/d of either brown seaweed extract or placebo combined with individualized nutritional advice for moderate weight loss over a period of 12 weeks. Glycemic, anthropometric, blood pressure, heart rate, body composition, lipid profile, gut integrity, and oxidative and inflammatory markers were measured before and at the end of the trial. No effect was observed on blood glucose. We observed significant but small decreases in plasma C-peptide at 120 min during 2 h-OGTT (3218 +/- 181 at pre-intervention vs. 2865 +/- 186 pmol/L at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 3004 +/- 199 at pre-intervention vs. 2954 +/- 179 pmol/L at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.002), heart rate (72 +/- 10 at pre-intervention vs. 69 +/- 9 (n/min) at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 68 +/- 9 at pre-intervention vs. 68 +/- 8 (n/min) at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.01), and an inhibition in the increase of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) (1.3 +/- 0.7 at pre-intervention vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 pg/L at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 1.4 +/- 1.1 at pre-intervention vs. 2.2 +/- 1.6 pg/L at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.02) following brown seaweed consumption compared with placebo in the context of moderate weight loss. Although consumption of brown seaweed extract had no effect on body weight or blood glucose, an early attenuation of the inflammatory response was observed in association with marginal changes in metabolic parameters related to the prevention of diabetes type 2.",10.3390/md20030174,"Vodouhe, Marlene"," Marois, Julie"," Guay, Valerie"," Leblanc, Nadine"," Weisnagel, Stanley John"," Bilodeau, Jean-Francois"," Jacques, Helene",,,,,,,,,
S,"HANDBOOK OF CHOLESTEROL: BIOLOGY, FUNCTION AND ROLE IN HEALTH AND DISEASES",2016.0,Cholesterol-containing foods for children and adolescents: recommendations catching up with research,"The world's obesity problem has many causes, although energy intake is always higher than output with excess stored as fat. Between 1976 and 2003, obesity in children 6-19 years in the US increased from 5-7% to 16-21%. Consequences of obesity are related to inflammation, oxidation, and adipocyte function, the latter a primary reason for loss of appetite control and increased blood glucose and blood pressure. Dietary intake is not the only cause, but controlling intake of low-nutrient-dense high-energy-dense foods must be part of the answer. Cholesterol-containing foods, restricted in part because of misinterpretation of research data decades ago, included eggs, dairy foods (even low-fat) ones, and red meat. Food intake by children and adolescents from NHANES 2003-2006 showed that 18% of energy came from baked goods, sugared soft drinks, and candy/sugary foods while 16% energy was provided by milk, eggs, and meat. Nutrients from the latter groups include vitamin D, calcium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin E, and iron, all of which are deficient in diets in the USA (shortfall), plus other nutrients. Research indicates that bioactive compounds and high quantities of many nutrients in milk result in benefits ranging from less inflammation to less adipose tissue in adolescents. Eggs have the highest quality protein available with carotenoids to prevent macular degeneration plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA), choline, and several deficient nutrients. However, decades of warnings not to eat them worked. Lean meat provides key nutrients in a low-energy form, including high quality protein and bioactive peptides most of which have an antihypertensive effect. Most studies show that lean meat either decreases risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease or has no effect. Fish and shellfish (not fried) can provide a plethora of nutrients, not the least of which is marine oils, DHA and eicosapentanoic acid. Parenting style and modeling the behaviors that they encourage can impact food choices of children. Encouraging intake of cholesterol-containing foods can improve nutritional health of children and adolescents.",10.3920/978-90-8686-821-6_15,"Kubena, K. S."," McIntosh, W. A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,2004.0,"14-3-3-affinity purification of over 200 human phosphoproteins reveals new links to regulation of cellular metabolism, proliferation and trafficking","14-3-3-interacting proteins were isolated from extracts of proliferating HeLa cells using 14-3-3 affinity chromatography, eluting with a phosphopeptide that competes with targets for 14-3-3 binding. The isolated proteins did not bind to 14-3-3 proteins (14-3-3s) after dephosphorylation with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), indicating that binding to 14-3-3s requires their phosphorylation. The binding proteins identified by tryptic mass fingerprinting and Western blotting include many enzymes involved in generating precursors such as purines (AMP, GMP and ATP), FAD, NADPH, cysteine and S-adenosylmethionine, which are needed for cell growth, regulators of cell proliferation, including enzymes of DNA replication, proteins of anti-oxidative metabolism, regulators of actin dynamics and cellular trafficking, and proteins whose deregulation has been implicated in cancers, diabetes, Parkinsonism and other neurological diseases. Several proteins bound to 14-3-3-Sepharose in extracts of proliferating cells, but not in non-proliferating, serum-starved cells, including a novel microtubule-interacting protein ELP95 (EMAP-like protein of 95 kDa) and a small HVA22/Yop1p-related protein. In contrast, the interactions of 14-3-3s with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A subunit and NuMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) were not regulated by serum. Overall, our findings suggest that 14-3-3s may be central to integrating the regulation of biosynthetic metabolism, cell proliferation, survival, and other processes in human cells.",10.1042/BJ20031797,"Rubio, MP"," Geraghty, KM"," Wong, BHC"," Wood, NT"," Campbell, DG"," Morrice, N"," Mackintosh, C",,,,,,,,,
