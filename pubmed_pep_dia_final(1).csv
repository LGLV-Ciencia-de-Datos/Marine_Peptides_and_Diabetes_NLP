Diabetes & metabolism,2023,"GLP-1 receptor agonists effect on cognitive function in patients with and without 
      type 2 diabetes.","Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone of the incretin family, secreted in 
      response to nutrient ingestion, and plays a role in metabolic homeostasis. GLP-1 
      receptor agonist has a peripheral and a central action, including stimulation of 
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion and insulin biosynthesis, inhibition of 
      glucagon secretion and gastric emptying, and inhibition of food intake. Through 
      their mechanism, their use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been extended 
      to the management of obesity, and numerous trials are being conducted to assess 
      their cardiovascular effect. Type 2 diabetes appears to share common 
      pathophysiological mechanisms with the development of cognitive disorders, such 
      as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, related to insulin resistance. In this 
      review, we aim to examine the pathological features between type 2 diabetes and 
      dementia, GLP-1 central effects, and analyze the relevant literature about the 
      effect of GLP-1 analogs on cognitive function of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      but also without. Results tends to show an improvement in some brain markers 
      (e.g. hippocampal connections, cerebral glucose metabolism, hippocampal 
      activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging), but without being able to 
      demonstrate a strong correlation to cognitive scores. Some epidemiological 
      studies suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer a protective effect, by 
      delaying progression to dementia when diabetic patients are treated with GLP-1 
      receptor agonists. Ongoing trials are in progress and may provide 
      disease-modifying care for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients

      association between baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and a novel 
      insulin resistance score (IRS) with incident cardiometabolic diseases, and 
      whether randomized vitamin D or n-3 FA modify these associations. METHODS: 
      VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (NCT01169259) was a randomized clinical trial testing 
      vitamin D and n-3 FA for the prevention of CVD and cancer over a median of 5.3 
      years. Incident cases of T2D and CVD (including cardiovascular death, myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) were matched 1:1 on age, sex, 
      and fasting status to controls. Conditional logistic regressions adjusted for 
      demographic, clinical, and adiposity-related factors were used to assess the 
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per-standard deviation (SD) and 95%CI of baseline 
      insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and IRS (Insulin×0.0295 + C-peptide×0.00372) with risk 
      of T2D, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD). RESULTS: We identified 218 T2D 
      case-control pairs and 715 CVD case-control pairs including 423 with incident 
      CHD. Each of the four biomarkers at baseline was separately associated with 
      incident T2D, aOR (95%CI) per SD increment: insulin 1.46 (1.03, 2.06), C-peptide 
      2.04 (1.35, 3.09), IRS 1.72 (1.28, 2.31) and HbA1c 7.00 (3.76, 13.02), though 
      only HbA1c remained statistically significant with mutual adjustments. For 
      cardiovascular diseases, we only observed significant associations of HbA1c with 
      CVD (1.19 [1.02, 1.39]), and IRS with CHD (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]), which persisted 
      after mutual adjustment. Randomization to vitamin D and/or n-3 FA did not modify 
      the association of these biomarkers with the endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Each of 
      insulin, C-peptide, IRS, and HbA1c were associated with incident T2D with the 
      strongest association noted for HbA1c. While HbA1c was significantly associated 
      with CVD risk, a novel IRS appears to be associated with CHD risk. Neither 
      vitamin D nor n-3 FA modified the associations between these biomarkers and 
      cardiometabolic outcomes.",10.1186/s12933-024-02470-1 [doi],Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2024 Nov 2;23(1):393. doi: 10.1186/s12933-024-02470-1.,39488682,"['Qian, Frank', 'Guo, Yanjun', 'Li, Chunying', 'Liu, Yanyan', 'Luttmann-Gibson, Heike', 'Gomelskaya, Natalya', 'Demler, Olga V', 'Cook, Nancy R', 'Lee, I-Min', 'Buring, Julie E', 'Larsen, Julia', 'Boring, Jennifer', 'McPhaul, Michael J', 'Manson, JoAnn E', 'Pradhan, Aruna D', 'Mora, Samia']","['Division of Preventive Medicine, Center for Lipid Metabolomics, Brigham and ', 'Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

","The term metabolic/cardiometabolic/insulin resistance syndrome could generally be 
      defined as the co-occurrence of several risk factors inclusive of systemic 
      arterial hypertension. Not only that organizations, such as the world health 
      organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk 
      factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the 
      occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that 
      would consequently lead to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by 
      various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have 
      been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural 
      alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have

Veterinary world,2024,"Combination of curcuminoid and collagen marine peptides for healing diabetic 
      wounds infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Indonesia 
      indirectly reflects the high risk of developing chronic wounds that are 
      susceptible to infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is 
      an infectious pathogen that is resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, 
      antibiotic therapy is ineffective enough to treat chronic hyperglycemic wounds 
      caused by MRSA infection. Curcuminoids have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial 
      effects by inhibiting the enzymatic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of 
      inflammation. Collagen is a tissue regeneration inducer. The combination of these 
      two ingredients is expected to be an alternative therapy for MRSA-infected 
      hyperglycemic chronic wounds without the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hydrolacin-gel in wound healing 
      and inhibiting the growth of MRSA bacteria, as well as to determine the optimal 
      concentration of curcuminoids combined with collagen marine peptides (CMPs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydrolacin-gels were prepared by homogenizing curcuminoid 
      nanoemulsions and CMPs. The evaluation of preparation includes stability tests 
      and antibacterial activity tests. Wound diabetic mice were treated with various 
      combinations of curcuminoid and CMPs. Wound healing was observed based on 
      malondialdehyde levels as a marker of oxidative stress and histopathological 
      changes in the skin wound. RESULTS: Hydrolacin-gel was formulated by combining 
      curcuminoid nanoemulsion (more water soluble) and CMPs, with the ratio of formula 
      1 (1:2, curcuminoid 43.3 mg and CMPs 5.58 mg), formula 2 (1:1, curcuminoid 86.8 
      mg and CMPs 3.72), and formula 3 (2:1, curcuminoid 130.2 mg and CMPs 1.87 mg) 
      calculated based on the effective dose of curcuminoid 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) 
      and CAMPs 0.9 g/kg BW. Hydrolacin-gel had a potential antibacterial activity 
      against MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel induced wound tissue repair and reduced oxidative 
      stress caused by inflammation in diabetic-infected MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel could be 
      used for healing MRSA-infected diabetic wounds, especially formula 3 with the 
      ratio of curcuminoid: CMPs = 2:1. CONCLUSION: Hydrolacin-gel combining 
      curcuminoid nanoemulsion and CMPs effectively inhibited the inflammatory process 
      and increased re-epithelialization in MRSA-infected diabetic wound healing. 
      Hydrolacin-gel with curcuminoid (130.2 mg) and CMPs (1.87 mg) at a concentration 
      ratio of 2:1 appeared to be the best formula against MRSA infection in diabetic 
      wounds.",10.14202/vetworld.2024.933-939 [doi],Vet World. 2024 Apr;17(4):933-939. doi: 10.14202/vetworld.2024.933-939.

Marine drugs,2012,"Marine bioactives: pharmacological properties and potential applications against

      inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, 
      diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the 
      past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually 
      the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may 
      lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation 
      of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an 
      influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of 
      the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is 
      not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been 
      implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the 
      antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of 
      oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing 
      antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene and phenolic substances, 
      has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative 
      stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve 
      of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of 
      these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils,

      specificities, venom peptides have the potential to be developed into 
      biopharmaceuticals to treat various health conditions such as diabetes mellitus,

","The inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a promising approach for 
      regulating the blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
      Oysters, rich in functional peptides, contain peptides capable of inhibiting 
      DPP-IV activity. This study aims to identify the hypoglycemic peptides from 
      oysters and investigate their potential anti-T2D targets and mechanisms. This 
      research utilized virtual screening for the peptide selection, followed by in 
      vitro DPP-IV activity assays to validate the chosen peptide. Network pharmacology 
      was employed to identify the potential targets, GO terms, and KEGG pathways. 
      Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide virtual 
      confirmation. The virtual screening identified LRGFGNPPT as the most promising 
      peptide among the screened oyster peptides. The in vitro studies confirmed its 
      inhibitory effect on DPP-IV activity. Network pharmacology revealed that 
      LRGFGNPPT exerts an anti-T2D effect through multiple targets and signaling 
      pathways. The key hub targets are AKT1, ACE, and REN. Additionally, the molecular 
      docking results showed that LRGFGNPPT exhibited a strong binding affinity with 
      targets like AKT1, ACE, and REN, which was further confirmed by the molecular 
      dynamics simulations showcasing a stable peptide-target interaction. This study

","Oxidative stress and abnormal glucose metabolism are the important physiological 
      mechanisms in the occurrence and development of diabetes. Antioxidant peptides 
      have been reported to attenuate diabetes complications by regulating levels of 
      oxidative stress, but few studies have focused on peptides from marine bone 
      collagen. In this study, we prepared the peptides with a molecular weight of less

      nehereus bone collagen. Furthermore, the effects of HNCP on blood glucose, blood 
      lipid, liver structure and function, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism 
      were studied using HE staining, kit detection, and Western blotting experiment in 
      streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. After the 240 mg/kg HNCP treatment,

      therapeutic potential.","Neuropathic pain, a challenging condition often associated with diabetes, trauma, 
      or chemotherapy, impairs patients' quality of life. Current treatments often 
      provide inconsistent relief and notable adverse effects, highlighting the urgent 
      need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review investigates 
      marine-derived bioactive compounds as potential novel therapies for neuropathic 
      pain management. Marine organisms, including fungi, algae, cone snails, sponges, 
      soft corals, tunicates, and fish, produce a diverse range of secondary 
      metabolites with significant pharmacological properties. These include peptides 
      (e.g., conopeptides, piscidin 1), non-peptides (e.g., guanidinium toxins, 
      astaxanthin, docosahexaenoic acid, fucoidan, apigenin, fumagillin, aaptamine, 
      flexibilide, excavatolide B, capnellenes, austrasulfones, lemnalol), and crude 
      extracts (e.g., Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella salina, Cliothosa aurivilli). 
      These compounds exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, such as modulating ion 
      channels (e.g., transient receptor potential channels, voltage-gated sodium, 
      calcium, and potassium channels, and G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying 
      potassium channels), interacting with cell-surface receptors (e.g., nicotinic 
      acetylcholine, NMDA, kainate, GABA(B)​, and neurotensin receptors), inhibiting 
      norepinephrine transporters, reducing oxidative stress, and attenuating

Molecular medicine reports,2017,"Marine collagen peptides reduce endothelial cell injury in diabetic rats by 
      inhibiting apoptosis and the expression of coupling factor 6 and microparticles.","The present study aimed to elucidate the role of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) 
      in protection of carotid artery vascular endothelial cells (CAVECs) in type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mechanism underlying this process. In an 
      in vivo experiment, diabetic Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups 
      (n=10/group): Diabetes control, and three diabetes groups administered low, 
      medium and high doses of MCPs (2.25, 4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, 
      respectively). Another 10 healthy rats served as the control. In an in vitro 
      experiment, human umbilical‑vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in 
      normal and high concentrations of glucose with or without MCPs (3.0, 15.0 and 
      30.0 mg/ml, respectively) for 24, 48 or 72 h. Blood vessel/endothelial 
      construction, inflammatory exudation and associated molecular biomarkers in 
      CAVECs were detected and analyzed. The results of the present study demonstrated 
      that in rats, MCP treatment for 4 weeks significantly lowered blood glucose and 
      attenuated endothelial thinning and inflammatory exudation in carotid‑artery 
      vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, the high‑glucose intervention significantly 
      increased cell apoptosis in HUVECs, and medium and high doses of MCPs (4.5 and 
      9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively) partially ameliorated this high 
      glucose‑mediated apoptosis and decreased levels of apoptosis biomarkers. In 
      conclusion, a moderate oral MCP dose (≥4.5 g/kg body weight/day) may be a novel

      by a low-molecular-weight polysaccharide from green microalga Chlorella 
      pyrenoidosa.","Globally, aging and diabetes are considered prevalent threats to human health. 
      Chlorella pyrenoidosa polysaccharide (CPP) is a natural active ingredient with 
      multiple health benefits including antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities. In 
      this study, the aging-related diabetic (AD) mice model was established to

      improved superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px),

      activity in the brain increased after CPP administration. In addition, through 
      histopathological examinations, it was evident that injuries in the liver, brain,

      Furthermore, metabolomics and correlation analysis revealed that CPP possibly 
      relived AD through changes in insulin levels and declined oxidative stress as

Nutrients,2021,"Edible Microalgae and Their Bioactive Compounds in the Prevention and Treatment 
      of Metabolic Alterations.
","Marine and freshwater algae and their products are in growing demand worldwide 
      because of their nutritional and functional properties. Microalgae (unicellular 
      algae) will constitute one of the major foods of the future for nutritional and 
      environmental reasons. They are sources of high-quality protein and bioactive 
      molecules with potential application in the modern epidemics of obesity and 
      diabetes. They may also contribute decisively to sustainability through carbon 
      dioxide fixation and minimization of agricultural land use. This paper reviews 
      current knowledge of the effects of consuming edible microalgae on the metabolic 
      alterations known as metabolic syndrome (MS). These microalgae include Chlorella, 
      Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Tetraselmis as well as Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis 
      as candidates for human consumption. Chlorella biomass has shown antioxidant, 
      antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects 
      in humans and other mammals. The components of microalgae reviewed suggest that 
      they may be effective against MS at two levels: in the early stages, to work 
      against the development of insulin resistance (IR), and later, when pancreatic 
      -cell function is already compromised. The active components at both stages are 
      antioxidant scavengers and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as carotenoids 
      and -3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid; EPA/DHA), prebiotic 
      polysaccharides, phenolics, antihypertensive peptides, several pigments such as 
      phycobilins and phycocyanin, and some vitamins, such as folate. As a source of 
      high-quality protein, including an array of bioactive molecules with potential 
      activity against the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes, microalgae are 
      proposed as excellent foods for the future. Moreover, their incorporation into

Nutrition & diabetes,2014,Fatty fish consumption and risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.,"OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that intake of fatty fish may protect against 
      both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hypotheses rest on the high marine omega-3 fatty 
      acid eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) and vitamin D contents, 
      with possible beneficial effects on immune function and glucose metabolism. Our 
      aim was to investigate, for the first time, fatty fish consumption in relation to 
      the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: Analyses were 
      based on data from a Swedish case-control study with incident cases of LADA 
      (n=89) and type 2 diabetes (n=462) and randomly selected diabetes-free controls 
      (n=1007). Diabetes classification was based on the onset of age (⩾35), glutamic 
      acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and C-peptide. A validated food frequency 
      questionnaire was used to derive information on previous intake of fish, 
      polyunsaturated long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and supplementation of 
      fish oil and vitamin D. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, body mass 
      index (BMI), family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, education, 
      and consumption of alcohol, fruit, vegetables and red meat. RESULTS: Weekly fatty 
      fish consumption (⩾1 vs <1 serving per week), was associated with a reduced risk 
      of LADA but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87, and 1.01, 95% CI 
      0.74-1.39, respectively). Similar associations were seen for estimated intake of 
      n-3 PUFA (⩾0.3 g per day; LADA: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.03, type 2 diabetes: OR 
      1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.58) and fish oil supplementation (LADA: OR 0.47, 95% CI 
      0.19-1.12, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest that fatty fish consumption may reduce the risk of LADA, possibly through 
      effects of marine-originated omega-3 fatty acids.",10.1038/nutd.2014.36 [doi],Nutr Diabetes. 2014 Oct 20;4(10):e139. doi: 10.1038/nutd.2014.36.,25329601,"['Löfvenborg, J E', 'Andersson, T', 'Carlsson, P-O', 'Dorkhan, M', 'Groop, L', 'Martinell, M', 'Tuomi, T', 'Wolk, A', 'Carlsson, S']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', '1] Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden ', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.', 'Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, ', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central ', 'Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['Journal Article'],"Löfvenborg, J E","Andersson, T","Carlsson, P-O","Dorkhan, M","Groop, L","Martinell, M","Tuomi, T","Wolk, A","Carlsson, S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,article,286,,10.1038/nutd.2014.36 ,10.1038/nutd.2014.36,10.1038/nutd.2014.36 ,PubMed

      assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-B) were 
      derived for all participants, and beta-cell function was further examined by the 
      area under the curve (AUC) of C-peptide. RESULTS: The median HOMA-IR score was 
      higher in adolescents with T2D compared to lean adolescents (6.1 vs. 2.1; 
      p = 0.002), but was not different from that of overweight adolescents (6.1 vs. 
      4.0; p = 0.322). The median HOMA-B was higher in overweight adolescents than in 
      lean adolescents (256.9 vs. 134.2; p = 0.015), and adolescents with T2D (256.9 
      vs. 119.8; p = 0.011). The mean AUC of glucose in adolescents with T2D was 
      1.8-fold higher than that of overweight adolescents, and 1.9-fold higher than 
      that of lean adolescents (p < 0.001). Although the median AUC of C-peptide in 
      adolescents with T2D was lower than that of overweight and lean adolescents, this 
      difference was not statistically significant (230.7 vs. 336.6 vs. 
      267.3 nmol/l120 min, respectively; p = 0.215). CONCLUSION: Among Peruvian 
      adolescents with T2D, insulin resistance is the most prominent characteristic,

Biomacromolecules,2021,Sustained Release Systems for Delivery of Therapeutic Peptide/Protein.,"Peptide/protein therapeutics have been significantly applied in the clinical 
      treatment of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, etc. owing to their high 
      biocompatibility, specificity, and therapeutic efficacy. However, due to their 
      immunogenicity, instability stemming from its complex tertiary and quaternary 
      structure, vulnerability to enzyme degradation, and rapid renal clearance, the 
      clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is significantly confined. 
      Though nanotechnology has been demonstrated to prevent enzyme degradation of the 
      protein therapeutics and thus enhance the half-life, issues such as initial burst 
      release and uncontrollable release kinetics are still unsolved. Moreover, the 
      traditional administration method results in poor patient compliance, limiting 
      the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics. Exploiting the 
      sustained-release formulations for more controllable delivery of protein/peptide 
      therapeutics to decrease the frequency of injection and enhance patient 
      compliance is thus greatly meaningful. In this review, we comprehensively 
      summarize the substantial advancements of protein/peptide sustained-release 
      systems in the past decades. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of all

Military medicine,2020,Correct Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment Allows Sailor to Remain on Active Duty.,"Diabetes is a growing epidemic worldwide and among our active duty population, 
      posing a significant threat to maintaining military health and operational 
      readiness. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a growing clinical 
      phenotype of diabetes, with overlap between traditional type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this case, a 27-year-old active duty male 
      presented with polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and recent weight loss. He was 
      diagnosed with LADA, placed on a period of limited duty status and started on 
      insulin. Eight months after diagnosis, he was transitioned from insulin to a 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in an effort to be returned to full duty 
      status and worldwide deployable. Over 3 years after initial diagnosis, he has 
      achieved partial clinical remission. He remains on active duty, serving on a 
      medically limited platform with a single medication (a glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonist) and high compliance with a gluten-free, low-carbohydrate diet 
      and regular exercise. One should consider the diagnosis of LADA and its unique 
      management, especially in the younger active duty population. Not only is making 
      the correct diagnosis regarding the type of diabetes critical in regard to

Marine drugs,2022,"An Octopus-Derived Peptide with Antidiuretic Activity in Rats.
","Discovering new drug candidates with high efficacy and few side effects is a 
      major challenge in new drug development. The two evolutionarily related peptides 
      oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to be associated with a 
      variety of physiological and psychological processes via the association of OXT 
      with three types of AVP receptors. Over decades, many synthetic analogs of these 
      peptides have been designed and tested for therapeutic applications; however, 
      only a few studies of their natural analogs have been performed. In this study, 
      we investigated the bioactivity and usefulness of two natural OXT/AVP analogs 
      that originate from the marine invertebrate Octopus vulgaris, named octopressin 
      (OTP) and cephalotocin (CPT). By measuring the intracellular Ca(2+) or cyclic AMP 
      increase in each OXT/AVP receptor subtype-overexpressing cell, we found that CPT, 
      but not OTP, acts as a selective agonist of human AVP type 1b and 2 receptors. 
      This behavior is reminiscent of desmopressin, the most widely prescribed 
      antidiuretic drug in the world. Similar to the case for desmopressin, a single 
      intravenous tail injection of CPT into Sprague-Dawley rats reduced urine output 
      and increased urinary osmolality. In conclusion, we suggest that CPT has a

Food & function,2023,"Preparation, identification, activity prediction, and protective effects on 
      IR-HepG2 cells of five novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides from protein hydrolysate 
      of skipjack tuna dark muscles.","To produce peptides with high dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory 
      activity, neutrase was selected from five proteases (trypsin, neutrase, pepsin, 
      alcalase and flavor protease) with the highest degree of hydrolysis (DH) (18.23 ± 
      1.08%) and DPP-IV inhibitory rate (53.35 ± 4.02%) to produce protein hydrolysate 
      (NPH) from the dark muscles of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). Then, NPH-1 
      was isolated from NPH by gel permeation chromatography and found to possess the 
      highest DPP-IV inhibitory rate (65.12 ± 7.94% at 0.5 mg ml(-1)) in the separated 
      components (including NPH-1, NPH-2, NPH-3 and NPH-4). Subsequently, the available 
      prediction models of tripeptides and tetrapeptides with the DPP-IV inhibitory 
      rate were established using an artificial neural network (ANN). The RMSE (0.56 
      and 0.33 for the model established through collected tripeptides and 
      tetrapeptides, respectively) and R(2) (0.95 and 0.99 for the model established 
      through collected tripeptides and tetrapeptides, respectively) of the ANN model's 
      parameters were within acceptable limits, indicating that this model is 
      available. Next, the ANN model was applied to predict tripeptides and 
      tetrapeptides from the hydrolysate of skipjack tuna dark muscles, and five 
      peptides (Ala-Pro-Pro (APP), Pro-Pro-Pro (PPP), Asp-Pro-Leu-Leu (DPLL), 
      Glu-Ala-Val-Pro (EAVP) and Glu-Ala-Iie-Pro (EAIP)) possessing a noticeable DPP-IV 
      inhibitory rate (with DPP-IV IC(50) values of 42.46 ± 5.02, 37.71 ± 9.17, 58.85 ± 
      14.42, 49.94 ± 6.69 and 57.15 ± 6.13 μM, respectively) were screened from the 
      protein hydrolysate. The above five peptides were proved to effectively promote 
      glucose consumption in the insulin resistant-HepG2 (IR-HepG2) cell model 
      considering that the glucose consumption rates of APP, PPP, DPLL, EAVP and EAIP 
      treatment groups are all more than twice that of the dexamethasone group. 
      Accordingly, mechanistic studies showed that these peptides interacted with 
      PI3K/AKT and AMPK signaling pathways and promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K 
      p110, AKT and AMPK (the protein expressions of PI3K p110, p-AKT and p-AMPK in 
      APP, PPP, DPLL, EAVP and EAIP treatment groups are 1.64-2.22 fold compared with 
      that in the dexamethasone group), thereby enhancing glucose uptake and further 
      alleviating insulin resistance. These findings demonstrated that skipjack tuna 
      dark muscle is a potential DPP-IV inhibitory peptide source, and five DPP-IV 
      inhibitory peptides from its hydrolysate may exert potent anti-diabetic activity.

"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,"Fucoidan from Laminaria japonica Ameliorates Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in 
      Association with Modulation of Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in 
      Streptozocin-Treated Mice.
","Chronic diseases have been a leading cause of death worldwide, and polysaccharide 
      supplementation is an effective therapeutic strategy for chronic diseases without 
      adverse effects. In this study, the beneficial effect of Laminaria japonica 
      fucoidan (LJF) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated in 
      streptozocin-treated mice. LJF ameliorated the symptoms of T2DM in a 
      dose-dependent manner, involving reduction in weight loss, water intake, 
      triglyceride, blood glucose, cholesterol and free fatty acids, and increases in 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, catalase, glucagon-like peptide-1, and 
      superoxide dismutase. In addition, LJF regulated the balance between insulin 
      resistance and insulin sensitivity, reduced islet necrosis and β-cell damage, and 
      inhibited fat accumulation in T2DM mice. The protective effect of LJF on T2DM can 
      be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolites, e.g., 
      increases in Lactobacillus and Allobaculum. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics 
      analysis showed that the microbiota metabolite profile was changed with 
      LJF-induced microbiota alterations, mainly involving amino acids, glutathione,

      therapeutic applications because the ocean covers 70% of the earth's surface and 
      approximately 80% of all living organisms live in the sea. Therefore we have 
      investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, 
      ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics 
      based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 
      1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling 
      pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide 
      new drugs for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We have been searching for new types 
      of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B 
      inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi. This review presents their structural 
      diversities and unique biological properties. (2) In the course of our studies on 
      the induced production of new fungal metabolites, the Palauan marine-derived 
      fungus, Trichoderma cf. brevicompactum TPU199, was found to produce the unusual

      (PPARs), liver X receptor (LXRs) and farnesoid X receptor (FXRs) in type 2 
      diabetic patients with/without hypertension. METHOD Study population consisted of 
      200 type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension and 50 healthy subjects, 
      all of whom were randomly assigned to MCPs-treated diabetics (n = 50), 
      placebo-treated diabetics (n = 50), MCPs-treated diabetics with hypertension 
      (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics with hypertension (n = 50), and healthy 
      controls (n = 50). MCPs or placebo (water-soluble starch) were given daily before 
      breakfast and bedtime over three months. Levels of free fatty acid, cytochrome 
      P450, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, bradykinin, NO, and Prostacyclin were 
      determined before intervention, and 1.5 months, and 3 months after intervention. 
      Hypoglycemia and the endpoint events during the study were recorded and compared 
      among the study groups. RESULT: At the end of the study period, MCPs-treated 
      patients showed marked improvement compared with patients receiving placebo. The 
      protection exerted by MCPs seemed more profound in diabetics than in diabetics 
      with hypertension. In particular, after MCPs intervention, levels of free fatty

      diabetics following MCPs administration. CONCLUSION: MCPs could offer protection 
      against diabetes and hypertension by affecting levels of molecules involved in 
      diabetic and hypertensive pathogenesis. Regulation on metabolic nuclear receptors

Biochemical pharmacology,2024,"Interactions between glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and estrogens regulates 
      lipid metabolism.","Obesity, characterized by excessive fat accumulation in white adipose tissue 
      (WAT), is linked to numerous health issues, including insulin resistance (IR), 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The distribution of adipose tissue differs by 
      sex, with men typically exhibiting android adiposity and pre-menopausal women 
      displaying gynecoid adiposity. After menopause, women have an increased risk of 
      developing android-type obesity, IR, and DM2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
      receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are important in treating obesity and DM2 by 
      regulating insulin secretion, impacting glucose and lipid metabolism. GLP-1Rs are 
      found in various tissues including the pancreas, brain, and adipose tissue. 
      Studies suggest GLP-1RAs and estrogen replacement therapies have similar effects 
      on tissues like the liver, central nervous system, and WAT, probably by 
      converging pathways involving protein kinases. To investigate these interactions, 
      female rats underwent ovariectomy (OVR) to promote a state of estrogen 
      deficiency. After 20 days, the rats were euthanized and the tissues were 
      incubated with 10 μM of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA. Results showed significant 
      changes in metabolic parameters: OVR increased lipid catabolism in perirenal WAT 
      and basal lipolysis in subcutaneous WAT, while liraglutide treatment enhanced 
      stimulated lipolysis in subcutaneous WAT. Liver responses included increased 
      stimulated lipolysis with liraglutide. Transcriptome analysis revealed distinct 
      gene expression patterns in WAT of OVR rats and those treated with GLP-1RA, 
      highlighting pathways related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Functional 
      enrichment analysis showed estrogen's pivotal role in these pathways, influencing 
      genes involved in lipid metabolism regulation. Overall, the study underscores 
      GLP-1RA acting directly on adipose tissues and highlights the complex

      diets of 65% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 15% protein. The basal diet contained 15% 
      of total calories as vegetable oil (omega-6), and the test diets included 15%, 
      7.5%, or 3.75% calories as fish oil (MaxEPA). After three months of the basal 
      diet, patients were randomized to receive two 3-month omega-3 diets in the 
      following sequences: 15%/7.5%, 7.5%/15%, 7.5%/3.75%, or 3.75%/7.5%. Both 15% and 
      7.5% diets, regardless of sequence, significantly decreased serum triglycerides 
      but increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels as much as 98% and 
      LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio as much as 1.6-fold. Daily 
      insulin requirements of three diabetic patients increased progressively while 
      they received an omega-3-enriched diet for up to 2 years. In healthy controls, 
      favourable changes induced by an omega-3 fatty acid diet in serum lipids and 
      lipoproteins were associated with a tendency toward an inhibition of C-peptide 
      secretion following a meal challenge. We conclude that substitution of 
      commercially available omega-3 for omega-6 fatty acids improves 
      hypertriglyceridemia but may worsen other lipoproteins indices and may increase

Advances in food and nutrition research,2020,"Aquaculture and by-products: Challenges and opportunities in the use of 
      alternative protein sources and bioactive compounds.","There is a growing concern about chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, 
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and cardiovascular diseases resulting 
      from profound changes in the western lifestyle. Aquaculture by-products are 
      generated in large quantities and they can be profitably recycled through their 
      bioactive compounds used for health or food supplements. Improving waste 
      utilization in the field of aquaculture is essential for a sustainable industry 
      to prevent or minimize the environmental impact. In this sense fish by-products 
      are a great source of protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are 
      particularly studied on Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout. Fish protein 
      hydrolysate (FPH) obtained from chemical, enzymatical and microbial hydrolysis of 
      processing by-products are being used as a source of amino acids and peptides 
      with high digestibility, fast absorption and important biological activities. 
      Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic 
      (DHA) from fish discards have been reported to decrease postprandial 
      triacylglycerol levels, reduction of blood pressure, platelet aggregation and the 
      inflammatory response. Crustacean by-products can also be used to produce 
      chitosan with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity for food and pharmaceutical 
      industries and carotenoids with important biological activity. Seaweeds are rich 
      in bioactive compounds such as alginate, carrageenan, agar, carotenoids and 
      polyphenols with different biological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer, 
      antidiabetic, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, regarding

      (T2DM)-related hyperglycemia and β-cell apoptosis in rats induced by high fat 
      diet and low doses of streptozotocin and its therapeutic mechanisms. METHODS: 
      Groups of T2DM rats were treated with OMSS or bovine serum albumin (3.0 g/kg/d) 
      for 4 wk and their blood samples, together with those of normal control rats, 
      were collected before and 4 wk after treatment. The levels of fasting blood

      their influence on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. We evaluated the effects 
      of diets naturally rich in polyphenols and/or LCn3 of marine origin on glucose 
      metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk. METHODS: According to a 2 × 2 
      factorial design, individuals with high waist circumference and at least one more 
      component of the metabolic syndrome were recruited at the obesity outpatient 
      clinic. Eighty-six participants were randomly assigned by MINIM software to an 
      isoenergetic diet: (1) control, low in LCn3 and polyphenol (analysed n = 20); (2) 
      rich in LCn3 (n = 19); (3) rich in polyphenols (n = 19); or (4) rich in LCn3 and 
      polyphenols (n = 19). The assigned diets were known for the participants and 
      blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after the 8 week intervention, 
      participants underwent a 3 h OGTT and a test meal with a similar composition as 
      the assigned diet for the evaluation of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like 
      peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta 
      cell function. RESULTS: During OGTT, polyphenols significantly reduced plasma 
      glucose total AUC (p = 0.038) and increased early insulin secretion (p = 0.048), 
      while LCn3 significantly reduced beta cell function (p = 0.031) (two-factor 
      ANOVA). Moreover, polyphenols improved post-challenge oral glucose insulin 
      sensitivity (OGIS; p = 0.05 vs control diet by post hoc ANOVA). At test meal, 
      LCn3 significantly reduced GLP-1 total postprandial AUC (p < 0.001; two-factor 
      ANOVA). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Diets naturally rich in polyphenols reduce 
      blood glucose response, likely by increasing early insulin secretion and insulin 
      sensitivity. These effects may favourably influence diabetes and cardiovascular 
      risk. The implications of the decrease in insulin secretion and postprandial

      identify the brain metabolites and gut microbiota, respectively. EPO could 
      significantly improve glucose metabolism and activity of total superoxide 
      dismutase in serum. It also could regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
      arginine, and inosine-related metabolic pathways in the brain of aged diabetic

Aging,2021,"Dulaglutide improves muscle function by attenuating inflammation through 
      OPA-1-TLR-9 signaling in aged mice.","Dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, is widely used 
      to treat diabetes. However, its effects on muscle wasting due to aging are poorly 
      understood. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic potential and 
      underlying mechanism of dulaglutide in muscle wasting in aged mice. Dulaglutide 
      improved muscle mass and strength in aged mice. Histological analysis revealed 
      that the cross-sectional area of the tibialis anterior (TA) in the 
      dulaglutide-treated group was thicker than that in the vehicle group. Moreover, 
      dulaglutide increased the shift toward middle and large-sized fibers in both 
      young and aged mice compared to the vehicle. Dulaglutide increased myofiber type 
      I and type IIa in young (18.5% and 8.2%) and aged (1.8% and 19.7%) mice, 
      respectively, compared to the vehicle group. Peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial 
      biogenesis, decreased but increased by dulaglutide in aged mice. The expression 
      of atrophic factors such as myostatin, atrogin-1, and muscle RING-finger 
      protein-1 was decreased in aged mice, whereas that of the myogenic factor, MyoD, 
      was increased in both young and aged mice following dulaglutide treatment. In 
      aged mice, optic atrophy-1 (OPA-1) protein was decreased, whereas Toll-like 
      receptor-9 (TLR-9) and its targeting inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] 
      and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) were elevated in the TA and quadriceps (QD) 
      muscles. In contrast, dulaglutide administration reversed this expression 
      pattern, thereby significantly attenuating the expression of inflammatory 
      cytokines in aged mice. These data suggest that dulaglutide may exert beneficial

Journal of materials chemistry. B,2025,Effect and mechanism of oritavancin on hIAPP amyloid formation.,"Amyloidosis of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is closely related to 
      the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and serves as both a diagnostic 
      hallmark and a key therapeutic target for T2D. In this study, we discovered that 
      oritavancin (Ori), a glycopeptide antibiotic primarily prescribed for 
      Gram-positive bacterial infections, can dose-dependently inhibit recombinant 
      hIAPP (rhIAPP) amyloid formation. Ori specifically inhibited rhIAPP amyloid 
      formation at the initial nucleation stage but didn't affect mature rhIAPP 
      fibrils. As a result, Ori reduced amyloidosis of rhIAPP induced pancreatic NIT-1 
      cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Based on the results 
      from studies involving antibiotic homologues of Ori and its acid hydrolysates, we 
      demonstrated that both the N-(4-chlorobiphenyl) methyl group (CBP) and 
      glycopeptide backbone were necessary for inhibiting rhIAPP amyloid formation. The 
      mechanism behind Ori on rhIAPP amyloid formation lies in the direct interaction 
      of the two molecules identified by ESI-MS and molecular docking assays. 
      Consequently, this research not only lays the groundwork for developing novel 
      therapeutic approaches for T2D but also presents the opportunity to repurpose Ori 
      as a treatment option.",10.1039/d4tb02215g [doi],J Mater Chem B. 2025 Feb 5;13(6):2192-2202. doi: 10.1039/d4tb02215g.,39804635,"['Wang, Sheng-Nan', 'Li, Xin-Yu', 'Lu, Zhong-Xia', 'Liu, Lu-Xin', 'Xu, Xuan-Ping', 'Yu, Wen-Gong', 'Lu, Xin-Zhi']","['Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ', 'Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts of Qingdao National Laboratory for ', 'Key Laboratory of Glycoscience &Glycotechnology of Shandong Province, Qingdao ', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education; School of Medicine and ']",['Journal Article'],"Wang, Sheng-Nan","Li, Xin-Yu","Lu, Zhong-Xia","Liu, Lu-Xin","Xu, Xuan-Ping","Yu, Wen-Gong","Lu, Xin-Zhi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,article,179,,10.1039/d4tb02215g ,10.1039/d4tb02215g,10.1039/d4tb02215g ,PubMed
Heliyon,2024,"Lactoferrin's role in modulating NF-κB pathway to alleviate diabetes-associated 
      inflammation: A novel in-silico study.","Lactoferrin (LF), a multifunctional glycoprotein found in mammalian milk and 
      various exocrine secretions, plays a pivotal role in modulating various 
      responses. Lactoferrin plays a significant role in type-2 diabetes by improving 
      hepatic insulin resistance and pancreatic dysfunction however, the exact 
      mechanism for this improvement is not thoroughly elucidated. To this date, there 
      are no evidence that attributes the direct interaction of lactoferrin with 
      components of NF-κB pathway. Considering this precedent, the current study aimed 
      to investigate the interaction of LF with key components of NF-κB pathway using 
      molecular docking and simulation approaches. Results indicated that LF has shown 
      highly stable interactions with IL-1β, IL-6, IκBα and NF-κB, and relatively 
      weaker interactions with IKK and TNF-α. All four trajectories, including root 
      mean square of deviations (RMSD), root mean square of fluctuation (RMSF), 
      hydrogen bond interactions, and radius of gyration (RoG), confirmed the stable 
      interactions of LF with NF-κB pathway components. Molecular Mechanics/Generalized 
      Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis further supports their stable interactions. 
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide convincing 
      evidence that LF can interact with all six major components of the NF-κB pathway. 
      This study provides pioneering in-silico evidence that lactoferrin (LF) can

Frontiers in nutrition,2023,"Pea protein hydrolysate reduces blood glucose in high-fat diet and 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.","INTRODUCTION: Food proteins have been recognized as an ideal source to release 
      bioactive peptides with the potential to intervene nutrition related chronic 
      diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. Our previous 
      studies showed that pea protein hydrolysate (PPH) could suppress hepatic glucose 
      production in hepatic cells via inhibiting the gluconeogenic signaling. Thus, we 
      hypothesized that PPH could play the hypoglycemic role in vivo. METHODS: In the 
      present study, the mice model with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) was developed 
      by high-fat diet and low dose of streptozotocin injections. PPH was administered 
      orally with a dosage of 1000 mg/kg body weight for 9 weeks, followed by the 
      downstream biomedical analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that the 9-week 
      treatment of PPH could reduce fasting blood glucose by 29.6% and improve glucose 
      tolerance in the T2DM mice. The associated mechanisms included suppression of the 
      gluconeogenic pathway, activation of the insulin signaling and modulation of the 
      renin angiotensin system in the liver of the diabetic mice. In addition, the 
      levels of pro-inflammatory markers in both liver and serum were reduced by the 
      PPH treatment. CONCLUSION: The hypoglycemic effect of PPH in T2DM mice was 
      demonstrated in the present study. Findings from this study could provide

      Stress-Induced Exacerbation of Neuropathology Following Brain Blast Injury.","Blast brain injury (bBI) following explosive detonations in warfare is one of the 
      prominent causes of multidimensional insults to the central nervous and other 
      vital organs injury. Several military personnel suffered from bBI during the 
      Middle East conflict at hot environment. The bBI largely occurs due to pressure 
      waves, generation of heat together with release of shrapnel and gun powders 
      explosion with penetrating and/or impact head trauma causing multiple brain 
      damage. As a result, bBI-induced secondary injury causes breakdown of the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) and edema formation that further results in neuronal, 
      glial and axonal injuries. Previously, we reported endocrine imbalance and 
      influence of diabetes on bBI-induced brain pathology that was significantly 
      attenuated by nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin in model experiments. 
      Cerebrolysin is a balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors, and 
      active peptide fragment is capable of neuroprotection in several neurological 
      insults. Exposure to heat stress alone causes BBB damage, edema formation and

      173.2 ± 127.8 vs. 422.0 ± 243.6 pg mL(-1), post-operation P = 0.001). Fasting and 
      postprandial increases from pre-operative values in secondary (r = 0.57, 
      P = 0.02; r = 0.58, P = 0.01), conjugated (r = 0.50, P = 0.01; r = 0.48,

      secondary-conjugated (r = 0.53, P = 0.02; r = 0.60, P = 0.01) BAs correlated with 
      decreases in the postprandial states of glucose (defined by area under the curve 
      (AUC) over 120 min (AUC(0-120min))). Increases in postprandial primary-conjugated 
      BAs were found to be associated with decreases in HOMA-IR (r = 0.45, P = 0.05). 
      However, increases in fasting and postprandial taurine-conjugated BA correlated 
      with decreases in both basal insulin secretion rate (r = 0.47, P = 0.04; 
      r = 0.48, P = 0.04) and C-peptide level (r = 0.45, P = 0.05; r = 0.47, P = 0.04). 
      After 3 months, fasting and postprandial increases in secondary (r = 0.51, 
      P = 0.03; r = 0.48, P = 0.04), secondary-conjugated (r = 0.52, P = 0.02; 
      r = 0.51, P = 0.03) and non-12α-OH (r = 0.51, P = 0.02; r = 0.58, P = 0.01) BAs 
      were found to correlate with increases in Stumvoll Insulin Sensitivity Index. 
      Increases in both fasting and postprandial 12α-OH BAs were correlated with the 
      decreases in glucose AUC (r = 0.46, P = 0.05; r = 0.41, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Both GBP and SG achieve increases in many BA species as early as 3 days 
      post-operation, which are sustained at 3 months post-operation. Rises in 
      secondary BA and conjugated forms are correlated with early improvements in 
      glucose metabolism at 3 days post-operation. These along with 12α-OH BA 
      correlated with improved glucose metabolism at 3 months post-operation,

      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to explore the effect of the 
      interaction between potential probiotics and bitter gourd extract (BGE) or 
      mulberry leaf extract (MLE) on T2DM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Potential probiotics 
      were tested for their gastrointestinal tract viability and growth situation 
      combined with BGE and MLE in vitro. The diabetes model was constructed in C57BL/6 
      mice, and the potential effect and mechanism of regulating blood glucose were 
      verified. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE), gas chromatography (GC), ELISA, and 
      RT-PCR were also used for analysis. The results showed that Lactobacillus casei

PloS one,2015,"Pathway-based analysis of genome-wide siRNA screens reveals the regulatory 
      landscape of APP processing.","The progressive aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is a major trait of 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Aβ is produced as a result of proteolytic processing of 
      the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Processing of APP is mediated by multiple 
      enzymes, resulting in the production of distinct peptide products: the 
      non-amyloidogenic peptide sAPPα and the amyloidogenic peptides sAPPβ, Aβ40, and 
      Aβ42. Using a pathway-based approach, we analyzed a large-scale siRNA screen that 
      measured the production of different APP proteolytic products. Our analysis 
      identified many of the biological processes/pathways that are known to regulate 
      APP processing and have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, as well as revealing 
      novel regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that some of these 
      processes differentially regulate APP processing, with some mechanisms favouring 
      production of certain peptide species over others. For example, synaptic 
      transmission having a bias towards regulating Aβ40 production over Aβ42 as well 
      as processes involved in insulin and pancreatic biology having a bias for sAPPβ 
      production over sAPPα. In addition, some of the pathways identified as regulators 
      of APP processing contain genes (CLU, BIN1, CR1, PICALM, TREM2, SORL1, MEF2C,

      Alzheimer's Disease in a Zebrafish Model via the Inhibition of Matrix 
      Metalloprotease-13.
","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major type of dementia disorder. Common cognitive 
      changes occur as a result of cerebrovascular damage (CVD) via the disruption of 
      matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). In diabetic cases, the progress of vascular

Scientific reports,2024,"Phenotypic screening in zebrafish larvae identifies promising cyanobacterial 
      strains and pheophorbide a as insulin mimetics.","Diabetes is a pandemic disease that causes the loss of control of glucose 
      regulation in the organism, in consequence of dysfunction of insulin production 
      or functionality. In this work, the antidiabetic bioactivity of 182 fractions 
      from 19 cyanobacteria strains derived from the LEGE Culture Collection were 
      analysed using the 2-NBDG assay in zebrafish larvae. From this initial screening, 
      two fractions (57 (06104_D) and 107 (03283_B)) were identified as promising 
      insulin mimetics. These were further characterized by measuring glucose levels in 
      whole larvae, the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT 1-3) using western 
      blot, and the mRNA expression levels of the glut2, pepck, and insa genes using 
      real-time qPCR. Both fractions showed a decrease in free glucose levels. 
      Furthermore, exposure to fraction 06104_D decreased GLUT1 and increased insa mRNA 
      levels. The chemical composition of these fractions was determined using 
      LC-HRESIMS/MS and compared to inactive fractions of the same polarity in order to 
      identify the unique bioactive molecules. The molecular networks constructed using 
      the GNPS platform revealed that fraction 06104_D contained mass clusters 
      primarily composed of chlorins, lipids, and terpenoids, while fraction 03283_B 
      contained xanthophylls, peptides, and terpenoids. To correlate the observed 
      activity with the chemical composition of fraction 06104_D, pheophorbide a was 
      chosen as a representative of chlorophyll derivatives. Exposure to zebrafish 
      larvae at 10 and 20 µM confirmed the increased glucose uptake on the 2-NBDG

      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), calls for more knowledge on dietary 
      treatments targeting the specific metabolic pathways involved in these 
      conditions. Several studies have shown a protein preload before a meal to be 
      effective in lowering the postprandial glycaemic response in healthy individuals 
      and patients with T2DM. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of 
      a marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on 
      postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy, middle-aged to elderly subjects. This 
      double-blind cross-over trial (n 41) included two study days with 4-7 d wash-out 
      in between. The intervention consisted of 20 mg of MPH (or casein as control) per 
      kg body weight given before a breakfast meal. The primary outcome was 
      postprandial response in glucose metabolism, measured by samples of serum 
      glucose, insulin and plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in 20 min intervals 
      for 180 min. In a mixed-model regression analysis, no differences were observed

      diabetes (T2D) in vitro and in vivo. This study compared amylin 
      oligomerization/expression and signal transduction under endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) stress and oxidative stress. pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing INS-1E cells 
      presented different patterns of amylin oligomerization/expression under ER stress 
      and oxidative stress. Amylin oligomerization/expression under ER stress showed 
      three amylin oligomers of less than 15 kDa size in pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing 
      cells, while one band was detected under oxidative stress. Under ER stress 
      conditions, HIF1α, p-ERK, CHOP, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Bax were significantly increased

      catalase, and Bcl-2 were significantly reduced in pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing cells 
      compared to the control, whereas p-mTOR, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Bax were significantly

Frontiers in physiology,2018,The Case Study of Nesfatin-1 in the Pancreas of Tursiops truncatus.,"Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is an anorexigenic peptide involved in the regulation of 
      homeostatic feeding. Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other 
      organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from 
      β-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in 
      metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it 
      has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully 
      replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and 
      maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This 
      correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating 
      physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized 
      Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops 
      truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and 
      post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the 
      University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four 
      animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. 
      Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were 
      distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in α-cells. Similar 
      to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically 
      significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the 
      other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the 
      main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the 
      involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.",10.3389/fphys.2018.01845 [doi],Front Physiol. 2018 Dec 19;9:1845. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2018.01845. eCollection ,30618845,"['Gatta, Claudia', 'De Felice, Elena', ""D'Angelo, Livia"", 'Maruccio, Lucianna', 'Leggieri, Adele', 'Lucini, Carla', 'Palladino, Antonio', 'Paolucci, Marina', 'Scocco, Paola', 'Varricchio, Ettore', 'de Girolamo, Paolo']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ', 'School of Biosciences and Veterinary Medicine, University of Camerino, Camerino, ', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ', 'Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ', 'Center for Advanced Biomaterials for Health Care, IIT@CRIB, Istituto Italiano di ', 'Department of Science and Technology, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', 'School of Biosciences and Veterinary Medicine, University of Camerino, Camerino, ', 'Department of Science and Technology, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples ']",['Journal Article'],"Gatta, Claudia","De Felice, Elena","D'Angelo, Livia","Maruccio, Lucianna","Leggieri, Adele","Lucini, Carla","Palladino, Antonio","Paolucci, Marina","Scocco, Paola","Varricchio, Ettore","de Girolamo, Paolo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,article,240,,10.3389/fphys.2018.01845 ,10.3389/fphys.2018.01845,10.3389/fphys.2018.01845 ,PubMed

      novo implant in primary prevention ICD recipients.","BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is 
      contraindicated in those with <1-year life expectancy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to develop a risk prediction score for 1-year mortality in 
      patients with primary prevention ICDs and to determine the incremental 
      improvement in discrimination when serum-based biomarkers are added to 
      traditional clinical variables. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Prospective 
      Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators, a large 
      prospective observational study of patients undergoing primary prevention ICD 
      implantation who were extensively phenotyped for clinical and serum-based 
      biomarkers. We identified variables predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized 
      them into a comprehensive risk scoring construct using backward selection. 
      RESULTS: Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a 
      reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD 
      implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New 
      York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good 
      discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 
      biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 
      and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients 
      with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 2.7%, 
      16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Individuals with more comorbidities 
      and elevation of specific serum biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause 
      mortality despite being deemed as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A 
      simple risk score composed of readily available clinical data and serum

Marine drugs,2015,"A New Member of the TBC1D15 Family from Chiloscyllium plagiosum: Rab

      liver of Chiloscyllium. It can effectively protect islet cells and improve 
      complications in mice with alloxan-induced diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that 
      the APSL sequence is present in the N-terminus of novel TBC (Tre-2, Bub2 and 
      Cdc16) domain family, member 15 (TBC1D15) from Chiloscyllium plagiosum. This 
      shark TBC1D15 gene, which contains an ORF of 2088 bp, was identified from a cDNA 
      library of regenerating shark liver. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the gene 
      is highly homologous to TBC1D15 genes from other species. Moreover, the 
      N-terminus of shark TBC1D15 contains a motif of unknown function (DUF3548), which 
      encompasses the APSL fragment. Rab-GAP activity analysis showed that shark

      (UU) by high temperature/pressure and ultra-wave assisted lysis on erectile 
      dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty 
      12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Diabetes was induced by 
      a one-time intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50mg/kg). One week later, 
      the diabetic rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, 
      untreated diabetes control, and groups treated with 100 or 500mg/kg/d UU peptide. 
      Rats were fed with UU peptide by intragastric administration for 8 weeks. After 8 
      weeks, penile hemodynamic function was evaluated in all groups by measuring the 
      intracavernosal pressure after electrostimulating the cavernous nerve. Nitric

      Sensitivity.","BACKGROUND: Fucoidan is derived from seaweed widely used in Japanese cuisine, but 
      little is known about its influence on glucose metabolism. To obtain information 
      about the physiological effects of fucoidan on glucose metabolism, the digestive 
      system, and the gustatory system controlling taste sensation in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      study. METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes on diet therapy were 
      recruited from an outpatient clinic (22 men and 8 women aged 59.10 ± 13.24 years, 
      body mass index: 25.18 ± 3.88, hemoglobin A1c: 7.04 ± 1.24%). They were divided 
      into 2 groups and underwent 2 interventions with a 4-week interval. One group 
      received fucoidan for 12 weeks (a daily 60 mL test beverage containing 1,620 mg 
      of fucoidan) and then placebo (60 mL) for the subsequent 12-week period, while 
      the order was reversed in the other group. Evaluation was performed just before 
      and after each intervention. Taste sensitivity was measured for 5 basic tastes by 
      the filter paper disk method and food intake was evaluated with a validated diet 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: No adverse events occurred during the study period. 
      Despite no change of the diet, stool frequency increased during fucoidan intake 
      (from 7.78 ± 4.64/week in Week 1 to 9.15 ± 5.03/week in Week 5, P < 0.001), and 
      it increased more in lean subjects. In 11 subjects whose stool frequency exceeded 
      the mean value, the thresholds for sweet, salty, bitter and umami tastes were 
      significantly reduced (enhancement of sensitivity) after fucoidan intake. In 14 
      subjects with normal HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 
      < 2.5), hemoglobin A1c decreased after fucoidan intake (from 6.73 ± 1.00 to 6.59

      bladder in addition to sensory function also exhibit ""efferent"" features 
      consisting in TRPV1-dependent release of tachykinins (TAC) affecting detrusor 
      smooth muscle (DSM) contractions. Our aim was to investigate the effects of two 
      novel polypeptide inhibitors of TRPV1 from the venom of tropical sea anemone 
      Heteractis crispa, APHC1 and APHC3, on the contractions of DSM from bladders of 
      normal and diabetic rats. MAIN METHODS: Experiments were conducted on 
      urothelium-devoid DSM strips from normal rats and rats 8weeks after 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetes by means of contraction force measurements. KEY 
      FINDINGS: Pre-exposure of DSM strips to APHC1 or APHC3 (200nM) specifically 
      inhibited CAP-induced, TRPV1-dependent contractions. Both peptides also 
      transiently enhanced basal tone and spontaneous contractions of DSM strips 
      followed by delayed suppression of electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked 
      nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) contractions. The decrease of the amplitude 
      of EFS-evoked NANC contractions by АРНС1 or АРНС3 reached 38.5±3.4% and 
      25.1±1.6%, respectively, in normal DSM strips and 46.3±3.3% and 43.9±1.8%,

      demonstrate that АРНС1 and АРНС3 may be considered as effective inhibitors of 
      bladder contractility especially during diabetic cystopathy. Modality of action

European journal of medicinal chemistry,2013,"Evidence for a new binding mode to GSK-3: allosteric regulation by the marine

      the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as Alzheimer's 
      disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, this enzyme constitutes 
      a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective 
      inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We 
      describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine 
      natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3β inhibitor. Experimental studies 
      performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3β 
      inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. 
      Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional 
      binding mode to GSK-3β. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified 
      an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3β inhibition. 
      The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related 
      analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first

      (iron overload) have higher levels of 2 h post-prandial plasma insulin than 
      healthy controls. A parallel reaction monitoring assay for dolphin serum 
      adiponectin was developed based on tryptic peptides identified by mass 
      spectrometry. Using identified post-translational modifications, a differential 
      measurement was constructed. Total and unmodified adiponectin levels were 
      measured in sera from dolphins with (n = 4) and without (n = 5) iron overload. 
      This measurement yielded total adiponectin levels as well as site specific 
      percent unmodified adiponectin that may inversely correlate with HMW adiponectin. 
      Differences in insulin levels between iron overload cases and controls were 
      observed 2 h post-prandial, but not during the fasting state. Thus, post-prandial 
      as well as fasting serum adiponectin levels were measured to determine whether

      median of 0.1 g fish oil per kilogram body weight, amounting to 0.04 g/kg of

      exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC(50) of 2.9 ± 0.1 µmol L(-1)
