The two evolutionarily related peptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to be associated with a variety of physiological and psychological processes via the association of OXT with three types of AVP receptors. Over decades, many synthetic analogs of these peptides have been designed and tested for therapeutic applications; however, only a few studies of their natural analogs have been performed. In this study, we investigated the bioactivity and usefulness of two natural OXT/AVP analogs that originate from the marine invertebrate Octopus vulgaris, named octopressin (OTP) and cephalotocin (CPT). By measuring the intracellular Ca2+ or cyclic AMP increase in each OXT/AVP receptor subtype–overexpressing cell, we found that CPT, but not OTP, acts as a selective agonist of human AVP type 1b and 2 receptors. This behavior is reminiscent of desmopressin, the most widely prescribed antidiuretic drug in the world. Similar to the case for desmopressin, a single intravenous tail injection of CPT into Sprague-Dawley rats reduced urine output and increased urinary osmolality. In conclusion, we suggest that CPT has a significant antidiuretic effect and that CPT might be beneficial for treating urological conditions such as nocturia, enuresis, and diabetes insipidus. © 2022 by the authors.

They are found in a limited amount in plants, animals, marine, and other natural food sources which help in the prevention of many diseases e.g. cancers, cardiac disorders, diabetes, etc. It is well known to us that nearly half of the worldwide biodiversity is constituted by different types of marine species and as a result, oceans, sea are enriched with valuable natural bioactive compounds such as proteins, peptides, amino acids, fatty acids, sterols, oligosaccharides, vitamins, and minerals, etc. These agents also help to enhance the nutritional as well as the therapeutic value of the food products. Every year nearly thousands of new compounds are isolated from a marine organism which further help in the discovery of new leads for the development of new drugs to treat or diagnose human diseases like cancer, viral diseases, inflammation, etc. For example, thyrsiferol, which is isolated from marine red algae (genus: Laurencia) on the experimental studies shows potent anti-viral and anti-tumour activities. Another example is marine sponge (genus: Insignia) which is a good source of terpenoids consisting of tetronic acids which act as anti-inflammatory agent, analgesic, and antibiotics. There are numerous examples of such marine products that are enriched with nutritional values and show many potent biological activities. In this article, we are going to discuss different marine products one by one with their biological and nutritional importances and also their role in the development of new drugs in the treatment of various human diseases. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097893142,"Pal, Dilipkumar","Raj, Khushboo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Blood vessel/endothelial construction, inflammatory exudation and associated molecular biomarkers in CAVECs were detected and analyzed. The results of the present study demonstrated that in rats, MCP treatment for 4 weeks significantly lowered blood glucose and attenuated endothelial thinning and inflammatory exudation in carotid-artery vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, the high-glucose intervention significantly increased cell apoptosis in HUVECs, and medium and high doses of MCPs (4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively) partially ameliorated this high glucose-mediated apoptosis and decreased levels of apoptosis biomarkers.

Besides, they are especially attractive for their rich and abundant amount of essential amino acids with proportions of 30%–40% which are comparable to other terrestrial organisms, such as legumes. Hence, protein from macroalgae is a highly valuable resource that can be used as food ingredients but also as a matrix to obtain protein hydrolysates (PHs) and so bioactive peptides (BAPs). Hydrolyzation usually implies a pretreatment of the macroalgae to later apply a chemical or biological hydrolyzation followed by purification. The laborious procedure to obtain PHs and BAPs has been demonstrated to be profitable since it implies an improvement in the associated biological properties when compared to the untreated proteins. Among the enhanced qualities, PHs and BAPs have high digestibility ranges (~80%) which was related to better bioaccessibility and so to improved bioactivities. Among them, antioxidant, antiobesity, antidiabetic, hypotensive, and antiinflammatory stand out and, even though antiplatelet or anticancer have been scarcely explored, they have been proven too. Therefore the high content and quality of macroalgae proteins point to these marine organisms as a valuable source to obtain PHs and BAPs with huge potential to design functional products aimed to improve health status or prevent the development of chronic and global ailments, such as obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases, which strongly impact in the human well-being. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Microalgae (unicellular algae) will constitute one of the major foods of the future for nutritional and environmental reasons. They are sources of high-quality protein and bioactive molecules with potential application in the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes. They may also contribute decisively to sustainability through carbon dioxide fixation and minimization of agricultural land use. This paper reviews current knowledge of the effects of consuming edible microalgae on the metabolic alterations known as metabolic syndrome (MS). These microalgae include Chlorella, Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Tetraselmis as well as Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis as candidates for human consumption. Chlorella biomass has shown antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects in humans and other mammals. The components of microalgae reviewed suggest that they may be effective against MS at two levels: in the early stages, to work against the development of insulin resistance (IR), and later, when pancreatic-cell function is already compromised. The active components at both stages are antioxidant scavengers and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as carotenoids and-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid; EPA/DHA), prebiotic polysaccharides, phenolics, antihypertensive peptides, several pigments such as phycobilins and phycocyanin, and some vitamins, such as folate. As a source of high-quality protein, including an array of bioactive molecules with potential activity against the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes, microalgae are proposed as excellent foods for the future. Moreover, their incorporation into the human diet would decisively contribute to a more sustainable world because of their roles in carbon dioxide fixation and reducing the use of land for agricultural purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

Blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation were measured. The expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscles and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) in livers of T2DM rats was also measured.

Vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may improve insulin resistance. We sought to examine the association between baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and a novel insulin resistance score (IRS) with incident cardiometabolic diseases, and whether randomized vitamin D or n-3 FA modify these associations. Methods: VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (NCT01169259) was a randomized clinical trial testing vitamin D and n-3 FA for the prevention of CVD and cancer over a median of 5.3 years. Incident cases of T2D and CVD (including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) were matched 1:1 on age, sex, and fasting status to controls. Conditional logistic regressions adjusted for demographic, clinical, and adiposity-related factors were used to assess the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per-standard deviation (SD) and 95%CI of baseline insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and IRS (Insulin×0.0295 + C-peptide×0.00372) with risk of T2D, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: We identified 218 T2D case-control pairs and 715 CVD case-control pairs including 423 with incident CHD. Each of the four biomarkers at baseline was separately associated with incident T2D, aOR (95%CI) per SD increment: insulin 1.46 (1.03, 2.06), C-peptide 2.04 (1.35, 3.09), IRS 1.72 (1.28, 2.31) and HbA1c 7.00 (3.76, 13.02), though only HbA1c remained statistically significant with mutual adjustments. For cardiovascular diseases, we only observed significant associations of HbA1c with CVD (1.19 [1.02, 1.39]), and IRS with CHD (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]), which persisted after mutual adjustment. Randomization to vitamin D and/or n-3 FA did not modify the association of these biomarkers with the endpoints. Conclusions: Each of insulin, C-peptide, IRS, and HbA1c were associated with incident T2D with the strongest association noted for HbA1c. While HbA1c was significantly associated with CVD risk, a novel IRS appears to be associated with CHD risk. Neither vitamin D nor n-3 FA modified the associations between these biomarkers and cardiometabolic outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208291979,"Qian, Frank","Guo, Yanjun","Li, Chunying","Liu, Yanyan","Luttmann-Gibson, Heike","Gomelskaya, Natalya","Demler, Olga V.","Cook, Nancy R.","Lee, I-Min","Buring, Julie E.","Larsen, Julia","Boring, Jennifer","McPhaul, Michael J.","Manson, JoAnn E.","Pradhan, Aruna D.","Mora, Samia",,SCOPUS

Antioxidant peptides have been reported to attenuate diabetes complications by regulating levels of oxidative stress, but few studies have focused on peptides from marine bone collagen. In this study, we prepared the peptides with a molecular weight of less than 1 kD (HNCP) by enzymolysis and ultrafiltration derived from Harpadon nehereus bone collagen. Furthermore, the effects of HNCP on blood glucose, blood lipid, liver structure and function, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism were studied using HE staining, kit detection, and Western blotting experiment in streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. After the 240 mg/kg HNCP treatment, the levels of blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mice decreased by 32.8%, 42.2%, and 43.2%, respectively, while the levels of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen increased by 142.0% and 96.4%, respectively. The antioxidant enzymes levels and liver function in the diabetic mice were markedly improved after HNCP intervention. In addition, the levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glucokinase (GK), and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (p-GSK3β) in the liver were markedly up-regulated after HNCP treatment, but the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PEPCK1) were down-regulated. In conclusion, HNCP could attenuate oxidative stress, reduce blood glucose, and improve glycolipid metabolism in streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. © 2023 by the authors.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175038041,"Lin, Qianxia","Guo, Yueping","Li, Jie","He, Shuqi","Chen, Yan","Jin, Huoxi",,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

However, human amylin has a high tendency to aggregate, forming isolated amylin deposits that are observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In search of new inhibitors of amylin aggregation, we undertook the chemical analyses of five marine macroorganisms encountered in high populations in the Red Sea and selected a panel of 10 metabolites belonging to different chemical classes to evaluate their ability to inhibit the formation of amyloid deposits in the human amylin peptide. The thioflavin T assay was used to examine the kinetics of amyloid aggregation, and atomic force microscopy was employed to conduct a thorough morphological examination of the formed fibrils. The potential ability of these compounds to interact with the backbone of peptides and compete with β-sheet formation was analyzed by quantum calculations, and the interactions with the amylin peptide were computationally examined using molecular docking. Despite their structural similarity, it could be observed that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of pyrrolidinones 9 and 10 with the protein sheets result in one case in a stable aggregation, while in the other, they cause distortion from aggregation. © 2024 by the authors.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202523263,"Alghrably, Mawadda","Tammam, Mohamed A.","Koutsaviti, Aikaterini","Roussis, Vassilios","Lopez, Xabier","Bennici, Giulia","Sharfalddin, Abeer","Almahasheer, Hanan","Duarte, Carlos M.","Emwas, Abdul-Hamid","Ioannou, Efstathia","Jaremko, Mariusz",,,,,,SCOPUS

Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human inflammatory disease.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce new approaches for treating obesity. Bioactive peptides have been used to treat metabolic disorders- such as type-2 diabetes and obesity; while also possessing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-viral properties. However, the development of these peptides has taken backstage due to their size, reduced stability, poor delivery and bioavailability, fast rate of degradation etc. But with the emergence of newer techniques for multifunctional peptides, mimetics, peptide analogs, and aptamers, there is a sudden revival in this therapeutic field. An increased attention is required for development of the natural peptides from food and marine sources which can mimic the function of mediators involved in weight management to avoid obesity. Herein, the search for the structures of anti-obesity peptides was carried out in order to establish their potential for drug development in future. An extensive search for the current status of endogenous, food and marine peptides, with reference to novel and interesting experimental approaches based on peptidomimetics for controlling obesity, was performed. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-specific agonist, GLP-1 dual and triple agonists, neuropeptides and prolactin-releasing peptide mimetics were specifically examined for their anti-obesity role. Novel peptides, mimetics, and synthesis interventions are transpiring and might offer safer alternatives for otherwise scarcely available safe antiobesity drug. A deeper understanding of peptides and their chemistry through the use of peptide engineering can be useful to overcome the disadvantages and select best mimetics and analogs for treatment in future. © 2019 Kumar.",Short survey,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065261665,"Kumar, Maushmi S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

The biomarkers of AD pathology were assessed via the estimation of the cerebral extravasation of Evans blue, tissue nitrite, amyloid beta-peptide aggregation, MMP-13 activity, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The results revealed that exposure to AST leads to ameliorative behavioral and biochemical changes. Hence, AST can be used for the management of AD due to its multi-targeted actions, including MMP-13 inhibition. © 2023 by the authors.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168741068,"Paramakrishnan, Nallupillai","Lim, Khian Giap","Paramaswaran, Yamunna","Ali, Nemat","Waseem, Mohammad","Shazly, Gamal A.","Bin Jardan, Yousef A.","Muthuraman, Arunachalam",,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

With the increasing rate of incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and rising cost of treatments, we investigated the anti-diabetic properties of extracts of common edible seaweeds in Europe including their ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzymatic activity, block sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) activity and stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and synthesis. The most promising seaweed extracts were tested for anti-hyperglycaemic activity in vivo. Some brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) extracts had inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase ranging from 13.9 ± 0.2% to 89.5 ± 0.4% (p < 0.001). However, none of the seaweed extracts was able to block SGLT-2 activity. Ethanol extracts of the kelp Alaria esculenta and water extracts of Laminaria digitata strongly inhibited DPP-4 activity by 91.3 ± 0.1% and 90.0 ± 0.2%, respectively (p < 0.001), while ethanol extracts of Ulva rigida (Chlorophyta) had the greatest potential to stimulate GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 synthesis (p < 0.001). A water extract of Porphyra linearis (Rhodophyta) significantly reduced the overall glycaemic excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test in normal mice (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate future potential for common edible seaweeds to be used as medicinal foods or bio-therapeutics to tackle type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting GLP-1 secretion, DPP-4 activity or alpha-glucosidase activity. © 2021 The Author(s).

Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from β-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in α-cells. Similar to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.

The future perspective on marine peptide research should focus on finding improved separation and purification technologies with enhanced selectivity and resolution for obtaining more novel peptides with high yield and low cost. In addition, by employing encapsulation strategies such as nanoemulsion and nanoliposome, oral bioavailability and bioactivity of peptides can be greatly enhanced.

MS has received a growing concern due to its rising prevalence in many countries. The consumption of high-calorie food, sedentary lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and stress conditions aggravate risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome. Investigations targeting the development of marine algae-based functional food products and drug candidates for attenuating MS have presently received increased attention. Scope and approach: This review delivers an overview of recent (past ten years) advancements in discovering marine algal natural products with therapeutic potential against metabolic syndrome. Pathophysiology of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the action mechanisms of algal natural products are taken into the discussion. Key findings and conclusions: Marine algae, a popular ingredient in East Asian cuisine, is proven to be a source of nutritional and biofunctional natural products with promising ability to remedy MS. These include bioactive polyphenols, sulfated polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and peptides with vast structural diversity. Moreover, algae are rich sources of dietary fibers that decrease the absorption of excessive nutrition and increase microbial functionality in the gut. By today, numerous algae-derived food supplements could be found in the market. The public should be educated on their beneficial effects, and research needs to be advance towards pre-clinical trials targeting the development of pharmaceuticals for the preventive and effective management of MS and its associated complications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078186422,"Fernando, Ilekuttige Priyan Shanura","Ryu, BoMi","Ahn, Ginnae","Yeo, In-Kyu","Jeon, You-Jin",,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Lepidium meyenii (maca) and marine collagen peptide (MCP) have individually shown potential in alleviating T2DM symptoms, but their combined effects remain underexplored. This study evaluated the impact of Blackbelt® coffee, enriched with maca and MCP, on fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and pancreatic and liver histology in a T2DM rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male rats with a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with metformin, maca, MCP, Maca/MCP® (Blackbelt® formulation), or Blackbelt® coffee for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were monitored, and fasting serum insulin, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance), HOMA-B (ß-cell function), and QUICKI (insulin sensitivity) were assessed. Histological analysis of the pancreas and liver was performed using haematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, treatments significantly reduced FBG levels compared to control (p<0.05), with Blackbelt® coffee notably increasing insulin production (p<0.05). All groups showed decreased HOMA-IR (p<0.05), and both metformin and Blackbelt® coffee groups had significant HOMA-B score increases (p<0.05). Histological analysis revealed improved pancreatic health in all treated groups, with significant liver histology enhancement in the Blackbelt® coffee group. CONCLUSIONS: Blackbelt® coffee improved FBG levels, insulin resistance, and ß-cell function more effectively than maca or MCP alone, and surpassed metformin in insulin production and hepatoprotective effects. Despite its promising potential for diabetes therapy, further research is needed to understand the synergistic effects of maca and MCP and the contribution of the coffee components. © (2025), (International Islamic University Malaysia).

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an infectious pathogen that is resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, antibiotic therapy is ineffective enough to treat chronic hyperglycemic wounds caused by MRSA infection. Curcuminoids have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects by inhibiting the enzymatic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Collagen is a tissue regeneration inducer. The combination of these two ingredients is expected to be an alternative therapy for MRSA-infected hyperglycemic chronic wounds without the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hydrolacin-gel in wound healing and inhibiting the growth of MRSA bacteria, as well as to determine the optimal concentration of curcuminoids combined with collagen marine peptides (CMPs). Materials and Methods: Hydrolacin-gels were prepared by homogenizing curcuminoid nanoemulsions and CMPs. The evaluation of preparation includes stability tests and antibacterial activity tests. Wound diabetic mice were treated with various combinations of curcuminoid and CMPs. Wound healing was observed based on malondialdehyde levels as a marker of oxidative stress and histopathological changes in the skin wound. Results: Hydrolacin-gel was formulated by combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion (more water soluble) and CMPs, with the ratio of formula 1 (1:2, curcuminoid 43.3 mg and CMPs 5.58 mg), formula 2 (1:1, curcuminoid 86.8 mg and CMPs 3.72), and formula 3 (2:1, curcuminoid 130.2 mg and CMPs 1.87 mg) calculated based on the effective dose of curcuminoid 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) and CMPs 0.9 g/kg BW. Hydrolacin-gel had a potential antibacterial activity against MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel induced wound tissue repair and reduced oxidative stress caused by inflammation in diabetic-infected MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel could be used for healing MRSA-infected diabetic wounds, especially formula 3 with the ratio of curcuminoid: CMPs = 2:1. Conclusion: Hydrolacin-gel combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion and CMPs effectively inhibited the inflammatory process and increased re-epithelialization in MRSA-infected diabetic wound healing.

Marine algae-derived peptides (MAP) represent a promising avenue, although, their potential remains mostly underexplored. This study employs pharmacoinformatics and in vitro methods to evaluate the antidiabetic properties of MAP and provide new insights their mechanisms to mitigate the prevalence of T2D. Through a systematic search and predictive modeling, peptides were identified and assessed for bioactivity, toxicity, and drug-likeness. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations with protein targets related to T2D identified binding sites that be used to optimize the activity of MAP. The structure-activity relationship profile of MAP reveals 13 candidates with probable activity (Pa) scores >0.4, indicative of insulin promoter. The peptide FDGIP (P13;Phe-Asp-Gly-Ile-Pro) from Caulerpa lentillifera had the best in silico assessment value compared to 50 other peptides and its activity was confirmed by in vitro data (e.g.EC50 60.4 and 57.9 for α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitions). Interestingly, in 3T3-L1 cells, P13 exhibited inhibitory activities against transcription factors and hormones (MAPK8-JNK1/PPARGC1A/Ghrelin/GLP-1/CPT-1) that can regulate blood sugar and decrease as anti-diabetes. P13 then appears to be a peptide with antidiabetic action that may be used in the formulation foods to manage T2D. © 2024 The Author(s)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191446983,"Kurniawan, Rudy","Taslim, Nurpudji Astuti","Hardinsyah, Hardinsyah","Syauki, Andi Yasmin","Idris, Irfan","Aman, Andi Makbul","Permatasari, Happy Kurnia","Wiyarta, Elvan","Surya, Reggie","Mayulu, Nelly","Putra, Purnawan Pontana","Tjandrawinata, Raymond Rubianto","Tallei, Trina Ekawati","Kim, Bonglee","Tsopmo, Apollinaire","Nurkolis, Fahrul",,SCOPUS

Current treatments often provide inconsistent relief and notable adverse effects, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review investigates marine-derived bioactive compounds as potential novel therapies for neuropathic pain management. Marine organisms, including fungi, algae, cone snails, sponges, soft corals, tunicates, and fish, produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites with significant pharmacological properties. These include peptides (e.g., conopeptides, piscidin 1), non-peptides (e.g., guanidinium toxins, astaxanthin, docosahexaenoic acid, fucoidan, apigenin, fumagillin, aaptamine, flexibilide, excavatolide B, capnellenes, austrasulfones, lemnalol), and crude extracts (e.g., Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella salina, Cliothosa aurivilli). These compounds exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, such as modulating ion channels (e.g., transient receptor potential channels, voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, and G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels), interacting with cell-surface receptors (e.g., nicotinic acetylcholine, NMDA, kainate, GABAB​, and neurotensin receptors), inhibiting norepinephrine transporters, reducing oxidative stress, and attenuating neuroinflammation. These effects collectively contribute to alleviating nerve degeneration and symptoms of neuropathic pain, including hyperalgesia, allodynia, and associated psychomotor disturbances.

Seaweeds are typically divided into three phylum-level groupings based on their natural pigmentation: red seaweed (Rhodophyta), brown seaweed (Phaeophyta), and green seaweed (Chlorophyta), with brown seaweed being the most prevalent. These seaweeds as, explained in the previous chapter, contains different bioactive compounds, not only due to their chemical nature, but also because marine algae produce a wide range of different metabolites to survive in extreme marine environments. Among these compounds are polysaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, different antioxidants compounds as phlorotannins and bioactive peptides. These components have shown their potential preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and even cancer. In the last years, biomedical research has led to advances in the knowledge of the gut microbiota showing that it acts in a symbiotic way with the host and playing a fundamental role in health and disease. It is clear is that a balanced microbiota is fundamental in the prevention of these pathologies. Therefore, the scientific community is in the search of new strategies or therapies for improving the composition of the gut microbiota. One of these strategies is the use of functional foods or ingredients as modulators. In this sense, the seaweed, and their components, especially, the polysaccharides, which are not absorbed in the small intestine, have arisen as potential prebiotics since these compounds seems to exert a positive effect in the gut microbiota in in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The present chapter outlines current knowledge about the effect of seaweed and seaweed derived compounds as potential modulators of the gut microbiota. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003348160,"Lopez-Santamarina, Aroa","Cardelle-Cobas, Alejandra","Sinisterra-Loaiza, Laura I.","Cepeda, Alberto","Miranda, Jose Manuel",,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Given the rapid increase in aquaculture in the last decade, it is expected that 99.33 million tons of by-products will be generated annually by 2022. Currently, the by-products are discarded or used mainly as fertilizer or animal feed or are further processed for fish oil extraction. However, it is becoming more evident that marine processing by-products are rich reservoirs of structurally diverse biofunctional nitrogenous components, such as proteins, peptides, and amino acids. They can contain significant levels of high-quality protein (10-23% w/w) and may act as substrates for the generation of bioactive peptides.

The MLP treatment significantly decreased the body weight, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels while also exhibiting a beneficial effect on hepatic and serum marker parameters in db/db mice. A histological analysis revealed a reduction in hepatic steatosis and epididymal fat following MLP treatment. Furthermore, poor glucose tolerance was improved, and hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities were elevated in MLP-treated mice compared to db/db control mice. Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of the AMPK protein after MLP treatment. In addition, the expression of lipogenic genes decreased in db/db mice.

Tilapia skin peptides (TSPs) are mixtures of small-molecular-weight peptides derived from tilapia skin. Rising evidence suggests that bioactive peptides from marine sources are beneficial for DN. This study aimed to investigate whether TSPs can alleviate the pathological progress in experimental DN by improving mitochondrial dysfunction through the activation of Bnip3/Nix signaling. In the current study, TSPs treatment alleviated the metabolic parameters and renal morphology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Additionally, TSPs treatment significantly activated Bnip3/Nix signaling and improved the mitochondrial morphology, reversed the over-production of mitochondrial superoxide and cellular reactive oxygen species and the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby inhibiting the expressions of fibronectin, collagen IV and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 in glomerular mesangial cells induced by high glucose.

Several studies have shown a protein preload before a meal to be effective in lowering the postprandial glycaemic response in healthy individuals and patients with T2DM. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy, middle-aged to elderly subjects. This double-blind cross-over trial (n 41) included two study days with 4-7 d wash-out in between. The intervention consisted of 20 mg of MPH (or casein as control) per kg body weight given before a breakfast meal. The primary outcome was postprandial response in glucose metabolism, measured by samples of serum glucose, insulin and plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in 20 min intervals for 180 min. In a mixed-model regression analysis, no differences were observed between MPH and control for postprandial glucose concentration (mean difference: -0 04 (95 % CI -0 17, 0 09) mmol/l; P = 0 573) or GLP-1 concentration (mean difference between geometric means: 1 02 (95 % CI 0 99, 1 06) pmol/l; P = 0 250). The postprandial insulin concentration was significantly lower after MPH compared with control (mean difference between geometric means: 1 067 (95 % CI 1 01, 1 13) mIU/l; P = 0 032). Our findings demonstrate that a single dose of MPH before a breakfast meal reduces postprandial insulin secretion, without affecting blood glucose response or GLP-1 levels, in healthy individuals.

Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein–protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204594902,"Sun, Yiting","Dakiiwa, Ayumi","Zhang, Menghua","Shibata, Takahiro","Kita, Masaki",,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

This study aimed at investigating the different effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) on the fatty acids of erythrocytes and glycolipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: The randomized double-blinded trial that was performed on 180 T2DM patients. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The fish oil (FO) group was administered with FO at a dose of 3 g/day containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the perilla oil (PO) group was administered with PO at a dose of 3 g/day containing α-linolenic (ALA), the linseed and fish oil (LFO) group was administered with mixed linseed and fish oil at a dose of 3 g/day containing EPA, DHA and ALA. Demographic information were collected and anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid metabolism indexes, erythrocyte fatty acid composition were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA. Results: A total of 150 patients finished the trial, with 52 of them in the FO group, 50 in the PO group and 48 in the LFO group. There were significant effects of time × treatment interaction on fast blood glucose (FBG), insulin, HOMA-IR and C-peptide, TC and triglyceride (TG) levels (P < 0.001). Glucose and C-peptide in PO and LFO groups decreased significantly and serum TG in FO group significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after the intervention. Erythrocyte C22: 5 n-6, ALA, DPA, n-6/n-3 PUFA, AA/EPA levels in the PO group were significantly higher than FO and LFO groups, while EPA, total n-3 PUFA and Omega-3 index were significantly higher in the FO and LFO groups compared to PO group. Conclusion: Supplementation with perilla oil decreased FBG while fish oil supplementation decreased the TG level.

Milk and marine substrates such as seaweeds are a rich source of both functional food and cosmeceutical ingredients. Indeed, both milk and seaweeds, in particular the red and green seaweeds, are a rich reservoir of protein that contain essential amino acids and peptides. Bioactive peptides, or cryptides, are amino acid sequences of between 2 and 30 amino acids in length that can impart a health benefit to the consumer when eaten or topically applied. They can be generated through hydrolysis and processing or, as is the case with endogenous antimicrobial peptides, can often be present naturally in organs such as skin. These peptides can exert beneficial effects through the inhibition of enzymes important in the control of saltwater balance and blood pressure (ACE-I, renin) as well as through the inhibition of other enzymes such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) that are important in the control of diseases associated with metabolic syndrome such as type 2 diabetes.

In recent years, increased attention has been directed towards the potential health benefits of peptides of marine origin. Some peptides have been found to exhibit antioxidative and antihypertensive properties. This chapter reviews the properties of marine-derived peptides and evaluates their health benefits. Whereas antioxidative peptides may provide a beneficial effect in the gut, preventing unwanted food oxidation, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides need to be absorbed in the intestine in order to enter the bloodstream and exert a physiological effect at the target site. According to theoretical knowledge, the antioxidants can prevent oxidative stress linked to several diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, as well as ageing. Evaluation of the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors from marine sources covers in vitro studies, animal studies and human clinical trials. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887243038,"Jensen, Ida-Johanne","Eilertsen, Karl-Erik","Mæhre, Hanne K.","Elvevoll, Edel O.","Larsen, Rune",,,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Here we tested for acute effects of marine n-3 FA on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A 4-hour lipid infusion (Intralipid [Fresenius Kabi, Halden, Norway], total of 384 mL) was compared with a similar lipid infusion partly replaced by Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi) that contributed a median of 0.1 g fish oil per kilogram body weight, amounting to 0.04 g/kg of marine n-3 FA. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps; insulin secretion (measured after the clamps), by C-peptide glucagon tests; and energy metabolism, by indirect calorimetry. Infusion of Omegaven increased the proportion of n-3 FA in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) compared with Intralipid alone (20:5n-3: median, 1.5% [interquartile range, 0.6%] vs -0.2% [0.2%], P = .001; 22:6n-3: 0.8% [0.4%] vs -0.7% [0.2%], P = .001). However, glucose utilization was not affected; neither was insulin secretion or total energy production (P = .966, .210, and .423, respectively, for the differences between the lipid clamps). Omegaven tended to lower oxidation of fat (P = .062) compared with Intralipid only, correlating with the rise in individual n-3 NEFA (r = 0.627, P = .039). The effects of clamping on phospholipid FA composition, leptin, adiponectin, or F2-isoprostane concentrations were not affected by Omegaven.

We studied dose-response relationships between ω-3 intake and indices of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 21 hypertriglyceridemic patients with (n = 6) or without (n = 15) diabetes, and 6 normal volunteers. All subjects consumed isocaloric diets of 65% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 15% protein. The basal diet contained 15% of total calories as vegetable oil (ω-6), and the test diets included 15%, 7.5%, or 3.75% calories as fish oil (MaxEPA). After three months of the basal diet, patients were randomized to receive two 3-month ω-3 diets in the following sequences: 15% 7.5%, 7.5% 15%, 7.5% 3.75%, or 3.75% 7.5%. Both 15% and 7.5% diets, regardless of sequence, significantly decreased serum triglycerides but increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels as much as 98% and the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio as much as 1.6-fold. Daily insulin requirements of three diabetic patients increased progressively while they received an ω-3-enriched diet for up to 2 years. In healthy controls, favorable changes induced by an ω-3 fatty acid diet in serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated with a tendency toward an inhibition of C-peptide secretion following a meal challenge.

For example, action of glucagons-like peptide I, an hormone that plays multiple roles in metabolic homeostasis and a potential agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is diminished by its susceptibility to DPPIV activity. The goal of this work was to the search for DPPIV inhibitory activity in the Caribbean marine fauna. The screening was done in aqueous crude extracts of species belonging to phyla Cnidaria, Mollusca, Annelida, Echinodermata, Poriphera, Chordata, Chlorophycota and Chlorophyta collected on the Northern coast of Havana (Cuba). An inhibitory activity was found in extracts of three species belonging to phyla Poriphera and Cnidaria: the sponge Xetospongia muta and the sea anemones Bunodosoma granulifera and Bartholomea annulata. The crude extracts from these species were treated with 2.5% final concentration of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or with heat (60 °C, 10 min). Both treatments increased inhibitory activity in X. muta but failed in B. granulifera and B. annulata extracts. Preliminary characterization indicated that in each case the effect on DPPIV activity is dose-dependent, the inhibition is slow and the molecule responsible for DPPIV inhibition has a low molecular weight. The present contribution shows that the detected species are promising sources of DPPIV natural inhibitors with potential therapeutic applications. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This may relate to their influence on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. We evaluated the effects of diets naturally rich in polyphenols and/or LCn3 of marine origin on glucose metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk. Methods: According to a 2 × 2 factorial design, individuals with high waist circumference and at least one more component of the metabolic syndrome were recruited at the obesity outpatient clinic. Eighty-six participants were randomly assigned by MINIM software to an isoenergetic diet: (1) control, low in LCn3 and polyphenol (analysed n = 20); (2) rich in LCn3 (n = 19); (3) rich in polyphenols (n = 19); or (4) rich in LCn3 and polyphenols (n = 19). The assigned diets were known for the participants and blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after the 8 week intervention, participants underwent a 3 h OGTT and a test meal with a similar composition as the assigned diet for the evaluation of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. Results: During OGTT, polyphenols significantly reduced plasma glucose total AUC (p = 0.038) and increased early insulin secretion (p = 0.048), while LCn3 significantly reduced beta cell function (p = 0.031) (two-factor ANOVA). Moreover, polyphenols improved post-challenge oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS; p = 0.05 vs control diet by post hoc ANOVA). At test meal, LCn3 significantly reduced GLP-1 total postprandial AUC (p < 0.001; two-factor ANOVA). Conclusion/interpretation: Diets naturally rich in polyphenols reduce blood glucose response, likely by increasing early insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. These effects may favourably influence diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The implications of the decrease in insulin secretion and postprandial GLP-1 observed with diets rich in marine LCn3 need further clarification.

Method Study population consisted of 200 type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension and 50 healthy subjects, all of whom were randomly assigned to MCPs-treated diabetics (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics (n=50), MCPs-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), and healthy controls (n=50). MCPs or placebo (water-soluble starch) were given daily before breakfast and bedtime over three months. Levels of free fatty acid, cytochrome P450, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, bradykinin, NO, and Prostacyclin were determined before intervention, and 1.5 months, and 3 months after intervention. Hypoglycemia and the endpoint events during the study were recorded and compared among the study groups. Result At the end of the study period, MCPs-treated patients showed marked improvement compared with patients receiving placebo. The protection exerted by MCPs seemed more profound in diabetics than in diabetics with hypertension. In particular, after MCPs intervention, levels of free fatty acid, hs-CRP, resistin, Prostacyclin decreased significantly in diabetics and tended to decrease in diabetic and hypertensive patients whereas levels of cytochrome P450, leptin, NO tended to decrease in diabetics with/without hypertension. Meanwhile, levels of adiponectin and bradykinin rose markedly in diabetics following MCPs administration. Conclusion MCPs could offer protection against diabetes and hypertension by affecting levels of molecules involved in diabetic and hypertensive pathogenesis. Regulation on metabolic nuclear receptors by MCPs may be the possible underlying mechanism for its observed effects in the study.

Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3β inhibition.

Similar to humans with insulin resistance, managed bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) diagnosed with hemochromatosis (iron overload) have higher levels of 2 h post-prandial plasma insulin than healthy controls. A parallel reaction monitoring assay for dolphin serum adiponectin was developed based on tryptic peptides identified by mass spectrometry. Using identified post-translational modifications, a differential measurement was constructed. Total and unmodified adiponectin levels were measured in sera from dolphins with (n = 4) and without (n = 5) iron overload. This measurement yielded total adiponectin levels as well as site specific percent unmodified adiponectin that may inversely correlate with HMW adiponectin. Differences in insulin levels between iron overload cases and controls were observed 2 h post-prandial, but not during the fasting state. Thus, post-prandial as well as fasting serum adiponectin levels were measured to determine whether adiponectin and insulin would follow similar patterns. There was no difference in total adiponectin or percent unmodified adiponectin from case or control fasting animals. There was no difference in post-prandial total adiponectin levels between case and control dolphins (mean ± SD) at 763 ± 298 and 727 ± 291 pmol/ml, respectively (p = 0.91); however, percent unmodified adiponectin was significantly higher in post-prandial cases compared to controls (30.0 ± 6.3 versus 17.0 ± 6.6%, respectively; p = 0.016).

Hypotheses rest on the high marine omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) and vitamin D contents, with possible beneficial effects on immune function and glucose metabolism. Our aim was to investigate, for the first time, fatty fish consumption in relation to the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: Analyses were based on data from a Swedish case-control study with incident cases of LADA (n = 89) and type 2 diabetes (n = 462) and randomly selected diabetes-free controls (n = 1007). Diabetes classification was based on the onset of age (>35), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and C-peptide. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to derive information on previous intake of fish, polyunsaturated long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and supplementation of fish oil and vitamin D. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, education, and consumption of alcohol, fruit, vegetables and red meat. RESULTS: Weekly fatty fish consumption (>1 vs o1 serving per week), was associated with a reduced risk of LADA but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87, and 1.01, 95% CI 0.74-1.39, respectively). Similar associations were seen for estimated intake of n-3 PUFA (>0.3 g per day; LADA: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.03, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.58) and fish oil supplementation (LADA: OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.19-1.12, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fatty fish consumption may reduce the risk of LADA, possibly through effects of marineoriginated omega-3 fatty acids. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927739071,"Löfvenborg, J.E.","Andersson, T.","Carlsson, P.O.","Dorkhan, M.","Groop, L.","Martinell, M.","Tuomi, T.","Wolk, A.","Carlsson, S.",,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860629862,"D'Orazio, Nicolantonio","Gammone, Maria Alessandra","Gemello, Eugenio","De Girolamo, Massimo","Cusenza, Salvatore","Riccioni, Graziano",,,,,,,,,,,,SCOPUS

Our aim was to investigate the effects of two novel polypeptide inhibitors of TRPV1 from the venom of tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa, APHC1 and APHC3, on the contractions of DSM from bladders of normal and diabetic rats. Main methods: Experiments were conducted on urothelium-devoid DSM strips from normal rats and rats 8 weeks after streptozotocin-induced diabetes by means of contraction force measurements. Key findings: Pre-exposure of DSM strips to APHC1 or APHC3 (200 nM) specifically inhibited CAP-induced, TRPV1-dependent contractions. Both peptides also transiently enhanced basal tone and spontaneous contractions of DSM strips followed by delayed suppression of electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) contractions. The decrease of the amplitude of EFS-evoked NANC contractions by APHC1 or APHC3 reached 38.5 ± 3.4% and 25.1 ± 1.6%, respectively, in normal DSM strips and 46.3 ± 3.3% and 43.9 ± 1.8%, respectively, in diabetic ones. APHC-peptide-induced transient enhancement of basal tone could be mimicked by serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride (300 μM). Significance: Our results demonstrate that APHC1 and APHC3 may be considered as effective inhibitors of bladder contractility especially during diabetic cystopathy. Modality of action of APHC-polypeptides via the mechanisms involving decreased TRPV1-dependent release of TAC from bladder afferents and suppression of TAC degradation due to their activity as endogenous proteases inhibitors is proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Bioinformatic analysis showed that the gene is highly homologous to TBC1D15 genes from other species. Moreover, the N-terminus of shark TBC1D15 contains a motif of unknown function (DUF3548), which encompasses the APSL fragment. Rab-GAP activity analysis showed that shark TBC1D15 is a new member of the TBC1D15 family. These results demonstrated that shark TBC1D15 possesses Rab-GAP activity using Rab7 as a substrate, which is a common property of the TBC1D15 family.

A high-throughput screen of marine natural product extracts led to the identification of a potent (Ki = 10 pM) peptidic HPA inhibitor, helianthamide, from the Caribbean sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus. Active helianthamide was produced in Escherichia coli via secretion as a barnase fusion protein. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex of helianthamide with porcine pancreatic α-amylase revealed that helianthamide adopts a β;-defensin fold and binds into and across the amylase active site, utilizing a contiguous YIYH inhibitory motif. Helianthamide represents the first of a novel class of glycosidase inhibitors and provides an unusual example of functional malleability of the β-defensin fold, which is rarely seen outside of its traditional role in antimicrobial peptides. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015474592,"Tysoe, Christina","Williams, Leslie K.","Keyzers, Robert","Nguyen, Nham T.","Tarling, Chris","Wicki, Jacqueline","Goddard-Borger, Ethan D.","Aguda, Adeleke H.","Perry, Suzanne","Foster, Leonard J.","Andersen, Raymond J.","Brayer, Gary D.","Withers, Stephen G.",,,,,SCOPUS
