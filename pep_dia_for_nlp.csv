Diabetes & metabolism,2023,"GLP-1 receptor agonists effect on cognitive function in patients with and without 
      type 2 diabetes.","Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone of the incretin family, secreted in 
      response to nutrient ingestion, and plays a role in metabolic homeostasis. GLP-1 
      receptor agonist has a peripheral and a central action, including stimulation of 
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion and insulin biosynthesis, inhibition of 
      glucagon secretion and gastric emptying, and inhibition of food intake. Through 
      their mechanism, their use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been extended 
      to the management of obesity, and numerous trials are being conducted to assess 
      their cardiovascular effect. Type 2 diabetes appears to share common 
      pathophysiological mechanisms with the development of cognitive disorders, such 
      as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, related to insulin resistance. In this 
      review, we aim to examine the pathological features between type 2 diabetes and 
      dementia, GLP-1 central effects, and analyze the relevant literature about the 
      effect of GLP-1 analogs on cognitive function of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      but also without. Results tends to show an improvement in some brain markers 
      (e.g. hippocampal connections, cerebral glucose metabolism, hippocampal 
      activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging), but without being able to 
      demonstrate a strong correlation to cognitive scores. Some epidemiological 
      studies suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer a protective effect, by 
      delaying progression to dementia when diabetic patients are treated with GLP-1 
      receptor agonists. Ongoing trials are in progress and may provide 
      disease-modifying care for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients

      being approved for its treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce 
      new approaches for treating obesity. Bioactive peptides have been used to treat 
      metabolic disorders- such as type-2 diabetes and obesity; while also possessing 
      anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-viral properties. 
      However, the development of these peptides has taken backstage due to their size, 
      reduced stability, poor delivery and bioavailability, fast rate of degradation 
      etc. But with the emergence of newer techniques for multifunctional peptides, 
      mimetics, peptide analogs, and aptamers, there is a sudden revival in this 
      therapeutic field. An increased attention is required for development of the 
      natural peptides from food and marine sources which can mimic the function of 
      mediators involved in weight management to avoid obesity. Herein, the search for 
      the structures of anti-obesity peptides was carried out in order to establish

Cardiovascular diabetology,2024,"Biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis and incident type 2 diabetes and

      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet associations with specific glucose-insulin 
      homeostatic biomarkers have been inconsistent. Vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty 
      acids (n-3 FA) may improve insulin resistance. We sought to examine the 
      association between baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and a novel 
      insulin resistance score (IRS) with incident cardiometabolic diseases, and 
      whether randomized vitamin D or n-3 FA modify these associations. METHODS: 
      VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (NCT01169259) was a randomized clinical trial testing 
      vitamin D and n-3 FA for the prevention of CVD and cancer over a median of 5.3 
      years. Incident cases of T2D and CVD (including cardiovascular death, myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) were matched 1:1 on age, sex, 
      and fasting status to controls. Conditional logistic regressions adjusted for 
      demographic, clinical, and adiposity-related factors were used to assess the 
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per-standard deviation (SD) and 95%CI of baseline 
      insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and IRS (Insulin×0.0295 + C-peptide×0.00372) with risk

      case-control pairs and 715 CVD case-control pairs including 423 with incident 
      CHD. Each of the four biomarkers at baseline was separately associated with 
      incident T2D, aOR (95%CI) per SD increment: insulin 1.46 (1.03, 2.06), C-peptide 
      2.04 (1.35, 3.09), IRS 1.72 (1.28, 2.31) and HbA1c 7.00 (3.76, 13.02), though 
      only HbA1c remained statistically significant with mutual adjustments. For 
      cardiovascular diseases, we only observed significant associations of HbA1c with 
      CVD (1.19 [1.02, 1.39]), and IRS with CHD (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]), which persisted

Veterinary world,2024,"Combination of curcuminoid and collagen marine peptides for healing diabetic 
      wounds infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Indonesia 
      indirectly reflects the high risk of developing chronic wounds that are 
      susceptible to infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is 
      an infectious pathogen that is resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, 
      antibiotic therapy is ineffective enough to treat chronic hyperglycemic wounds 
      caused by MRSA infection. Curcuminoids have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial 
      effects by inhibiting the enzymatic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of 
      inflammation. Collagen is a tissue regeneration inducer. The combination of these 
      two ingredients is expected to be an alternative therapy for MRSA-infected 
      hyperglycemic chronic wounds without the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hydrolacin-gel in wound healing 
      and inhibiting the growth of MRSA bacteria, as well as to determine the optimal 
      concentration of curcuminoids combined with collagen marine peptides (CMPs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydrolacin-gels were prepared by homogenizing curcuminoid 
      nanoemulsions and CMPs. The evaluation of preparation includes stability tests 
      and antibacterial activity tests. Wound diabetic mice were treated with various 
      combinations of curcuminoid and CMPs. Wound healing was observed based on 
      malondialdehyde levels as a marker of oxidative stress and histopathological 
      changes in the skin wound. RESULTS: Hydrolacin-gel was formulated by combining 
      curcuminoid nanoemulsion (more water soluble) and CMPs, with the ratio of formula 
      1 (1:2, curcuminoid 43.3 mg and CMPs 5.58 mg), formula 2 (1:1, curcuminoid 86.8 
      mg and CMPs 3.72), and formula 3 (2:1, curcuminoid 130.2 mg and CMPs 1.87 mg) 
      calculated based on the effective dose of curcuminoid 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) 
      and CAMPs 0.9 g/kg BW. Hydrolacin-gel had a potential antibacterial activity 
      against MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel induced wound tissue repair and reduced oxidative 
      stress caused by inflammation in diabetic-infected MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel could be 
      used for healing MRSA-infected diabetic wounds, especially formula 3 with the 
      ratio of curcuminoid: CMPs = 2:1. CONCLUSION: Hydrolacin-gel combining 
      curcuminoid nanoemulsion and CMPs effectively inhibited the inflammatory process 
      and increased re-epithelialization in MRSA-infected diabetic wound healing. 
      Hydrolacin-gel with curcuminoid (130.2 mg) and CMPs (1.87 mg) at a concentration

Marine drugs,2012,"Marine bioactives: pharmacological properties and potential applications against 
      inflammatory diseases.","Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in 
      inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, 
      diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the 
      past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually 
      the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may 
      lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation 
      of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an 
      influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of 
      the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is 
      not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been 
      implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the 
      antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of 
      oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing 
      antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene and phenolic substances, 
      has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative 
      stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve 
      of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of 
      these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, 
      carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, 
      including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and 
      anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining 
      attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory 
      degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published

","The inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a promising approach for 
      regulating the blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
      Oysters, rich in functional peptides, contain peptides capable of inhibiting 
      DPP-IV activity. This study aims to identify the hypoglycemic peptides from 
      oysters and investigate their potential anti-T2D targets and mechanisms. This 
      research utilized virtual screening for the peptide selection, followed by in 
      vitro DPP-IV activity assays to validate the chosen peptide. Network pharmacology 
      was employed to identify the potential targets, GO terms, and KEGG pathways.

      reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG), especially in the high-dose TOH group, 
      which reduced FBG by 58% versus the effect of metformin. Moreover, TOH exerted a 
      remarkable protective effect on hepatorenal function, as evidenced by increased 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and 
      decreased serum urea levels. Histopathological studies confirmed that TOH can 
      significantly protect the kidney and pancreas from histological changes, which 
      was of great benefit for ensuring the normal secretion of insulin and preventing 
      the occurrence of complications such as diabetic nephropathy. Two fractions with

Food chemistry: x,2022,"Metabolomics and biochemical insights on the regulation of aging-related diabetes 
      by a low-molecular-weight polysaccharide from green microalga Chlorella 
      pyrenoidosa.","Globally, aging and diabetes are considered prevalent threats to human health. 
      Chlorella pyrenoidosa polysaccharide (CPP) is a natural active ingredient with 
      multiple health benefits including antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities. In 
      this study, the aging-related diabetic (AD) mice model was established to 
      investigate the underlying hypoglycemic and antioxidant mechanisms of CPP. It 
      improved superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), 
      and malondialdehyde activities in liver and insulin secretion. CAT and GSH-px 
      activity in the brain increased after CPP administration. In addition, through 
      histopathological examinations, it was evident that injuries in the liver, brain, 
      jejunum, and pancreas were restored by CPP. This restoration was likely mediated 
      via the activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor/FOXO-1 (forkhead box O1) 
      pathway concurrent with the inhibition of interleukin-6 receptor/FOXO-1 pathway. 
      Furthermore, metabolomics and correlation analysis revealed that CPP possibly 
      relived AD through changes in insulin levels and declined oxidative stress as 
      regulated by phenylpyruvic acid. These findings suggested that CPP exerted 
      antioxidant and hypoglycemic roles in an AD mice model, thereby providing a sound 
      scientific foundation for further development and utilization of CPP.",10.1016/j.fochx.2022.100316 ,article,PubMed,"Qiu, Yinghui","Gao, Xiaoxiang","Chen, Ruoxin","Lu, Suyue","Wan, Xuzhi","Farag, Mohamed A","Zhao, Chao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrients,2021,"Edible Microalgae and Their Bioactive Compounds in the Prevention and Treatment 
      of Metabolic Alterations.
","Marine and freshwater algae and their products are in growing demand worldwide 
      because of their nutritional and functional properties. Microalgae (unicellular 
      algae) will constitute one of the major foods of the future for nutritional and 
      environmental reasons. They are sources of high-quality protein and bioactive 
      molecules with potential application in the modern epidemics of obesity and 
      diabetes. They may also contribute decisively to sustainability through carbon 
      dioxide fixation and minimization of agricultural land use. This paper reviews 
      current knowledge of the effects of consuming edible microalgae on the metabolic 
      alterations known as metabolic syndrome (MS). These microalgae include Chlorella, 
      Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Tetraselmis as well as Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis 
      as candidates for human consumption. Chlorella biomass has shown antioxidant, 
      antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects 
      in humans and other mammals. The components of microalgae reviewed suggest that 
      they may be effective against MS at two levels: in the early stages, to work 
      against the development of insulin resistance (IR), and later, when pancreatic 
      -cell function is already compromised. The active components at both stages are 
      antioxidant scavengers and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as carotenoids 
      and -3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid; EPA/DHA), prebiotic 
      polysaccharides, phenolics, antihypertensive peptides, several pigments such as 
      phycobilins and phycocyanin, and some vitamins, such as folate. As a source of 
      high-quality protein, including an array of bioactive molecules with potential 
      activity against the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes, microalgae are 
      proposed as excellent foods for the future. Moreover, their incorporation into 
      the human diet would decisively contribute to a more sustainable world because of 
      their roles in carbon dioxide fixation and reducing the use of land for 
      agricultural purposes.",10.3390/nu13020563 ,review,PubMed,"Ramos-Romero, Sara","Torrella, Joan Ramon","Pagès, Teresa","Viscor, Ginés","Torres, Josep Lluís",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrition & diabetes,2014,Fatty fish consumption and risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.,"OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that intake of fatty fish may protect against 
      both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hypotheses rest on the high marine omega-3 fatty 
      acid eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) and vitamin D contents, 
      with possible beneficial effects on immune function and glucose metabolism. Our 
      aim was to investigate, for the first time, fatty fish consumption in relation to 
      the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: Analyses were 
      based on data from a Swedish case-control study with incident cases of LADA 
      (n=89) and type 2 diabetes (n=462) and randomly selected diabetes-free controls 
      (n=1007). Diabetes classification was based on the onset of age (⩾35), glutamic 
      acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and C-peptide. A validated food frequency 
      questionnaire was used to derive information on previous intake of fish, 
      polyunsaturated long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and supplementation of 
      fish oil and vitamin D. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, body mass 
      index (BMI), family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, education, 
      and consumption of alcohol, fruit, vegetables and red meat. RESULTS: Weekly fatty 
      fish consumption (⩾1 vs <1 serving per week), was associated with a reduced risk 
      of LADA but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87, and 1.01, 95% CI 
      0.74-1.39, respectively). Similar associations were seen for estimated intake of 
      n-3 PUFA (⩾0.3 g per day; LADA: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.03, type 2 diabetes: OR 
      1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.58) and fish oil supplementation (LADA: OR 0.47, 95% CI 
      0.19-1.12, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings

      prediction models of tripeptides and tetrapeptides with the DPP-IV inhibitory 
      rate were established using an artificial neural network (ANN). The RMSE (0.56 
      and 0.33 for the model established through collected tripeptides and 
      tetrapeptides, respectively) and R(2) (0.95 and 0.99 for the model established 
      through collected tripeptides and tetrapeptides, respectively) of the ANN model's 
      parameters were within acceptable limits, indicating that this model is 
      available. Next, the ANN model was applied to predict tripeptides and 
      tetrapeptides from the hydrolysate of skipjack tuna dark muscles, and five 
      peptides (Ala-Pro-Pro (APP), Pro-Pro-Pro (PPP), Asp-Pro-Leu-Leu (DPLL), 
      Glu-Ala-Val-Pro (EAVP) and Glu-Ala-Iie-Pro (EAIP)) possessing a noticeable DPP-IV 
      inhibitory rate (with DPP-IV IC(50) values of 42.46 ± 5.02, 37.71 ± 9.17, 58.85 ± 
      14.42, 49.94 ± 6.69 and 57.15 ± 6.13 μM, respectively) were screened from the 
      protein hydrolysate. The above five peptides were proved to effectively promote 
      glucose consumption in the insulin resistant-HepG2 (IR-HepG2) cell model 
      considering that the glucose consumption rates of APP, PPP, DPLL, EAVP and EAIP 
      treatment groups are all more than twice that of the dexamethasone group. 
      Accordingly, mechanistic studies showed that these peptides interacted with 
      PI3K/AKT and AMPK signaling pathways and promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K 
      p110, AKT and AMPK (the protein expressions of PI3K p110, p-AKT and p-AMPK in 
      APP, PPP, DPLL, EAVP and EAIP treatment groups are 1.64-2.22 fold compared with 
      that in the dexamethasone group), thereby enhancing glucose uptake and further 
      alleviating insulin resistance. These findings demonstrated that skipjack tuna 
      dark muscle is a potential DPP-IV inhibitory peptide source, and five DPP-IV 
      inhibitory peptides from its hydrolysate may exert potent anti-diabetic activity. 
      In comparison, PPP may be the most potential active ingredient for healthy food 
      against type 2 diabetes mellitus in the five screened peptides considering 
      synthetically the DPP-IV inhibitory rate, bioavailability and synthesis cost.",10.1039/d3fo02948d ,article,PubMed,"Meng, Lingting","Song, Yan","Zheng, Bin","Zhao, Yadong","Hong, Bingyuan","Ma, Mingzhu","Wen, Zhengshun","Miao, Wenhua","Xu, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      adverse effects. In this study, the beneficial effect of Laminaria japonica 
      fucoidan (LJF) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated in 
      streptozocin-treated mice. LJF ameliorated the symptoms of T2DM in a

      triglyceride, blood glucose, cholesterol and free fatty acids, and increases in 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, catalase, glucagon-like peptide-1, and 
      superoxide dismutase. In addition, LJF regulated the balance between insulin 
      resistance and insulin sensitivity, reduced islet necrosis and β-cell damage, and 
      inhibited fat accumulation in T2DM mice. The protective effect of LJF on T2DM can 
      be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolites, e.g., 
      increases in Lactobacillus and Allobaculum. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics 
      analysis showed that the microbiota metabolite profile was changed with 
      LJF-induced microbiota alterations, mainly involving amino acids, glutathione,

      approximately 80% of all living organisms live in the sea. Therefore we have 
      investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, 
      ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics 
      based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 
      1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling 
      pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide 
      new drugs for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We have been searching for new types 
      of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B 
      inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi. This review presents their structural 
      diversities and unique biological properties. (2) In the course of our studies on 
      the induced production of new fungal metabolites, the Palauan marine-derived 
      fungus, Trichoderma cf. brevicompactum TPU199, was found to produce the unusual 
      epipolythiodiketopiperazines, gliovirin and pretrichodermamide A. Long-term 
      static fermentation of the strain induced production of a new dipeptide, 
      dithioaspergillazine A, whereas fermentation of the strain with NaCl, NaBr, and 
      NaI produced the Cl and Br derivatives of pretrichodermamide A and a new 
      iodinated derivative, iododithiobrevamide, respectively. Moreover, DMSO-added

      200 type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension and 50 healthy subjects, 
      all of whom were randomly assigned to MCPs-treated diabetics (n = 50), 
      placebo-treated diabetics (n = 50), MCPs-treated diabetics with hypertension 
      (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics with hypertension (n = 50), and healthy 
      controls (n = 50). MCPs or placebo (water-soluble starch) were given daily before 
      breakfast and bedtime over three months. Levels of free fatty acid, cytochrome

      determined before intervention, and 1.5 months, and 3 months after intervention. 
      Hypoglycemia and the endpoint events during the study were recorded and compared 
      among the study groups. RESULT: At the end of the study period, MCPs-treated 
      patients showed marked improvement compared with patients receiving placebo. The 
      protection exerted by MCPs seemed more profound in diabetics than in diabetics

Biochemical pharmacology,2024,"Interactions between glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and estrogens regulates 
      lipid metabolism.","Obesity, characterized by excessive fat accumulation in white adipose tissue 
      (WAT), is linked to numerous health issues, including insulin resistance (IR), 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The distribution of adipose tissue differs by 
      sex, with men typically exhibiting android adiposity and pre-menopausal women 
      displaying gynecoid adiposity. After menopause, women have an increased risk of 
      developing android-type obesity, IR, and DM2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
      receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are important in treating obesity and DM2 by 
      regulating insulin secretion, impacting glucose and lipid metabolism. GLP-1Rs are 
      found in various tissues including the pancreas, brain, and adipose tissue. 
      Studies suggest GLP-1RAs and estrogen replacement therapies have similar effects 
      on tissues like the liver, central nervous system, and WAT, probably by 
      converging pathways involving protein kinases. To investigate these interactions, 
      female rats underwent ovariectomy (OVR) to promote a state of estrogen 
      deficiency. After 20 days, the rats were euthanized and the tissues were 
      incubated with 10 μM of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA. Results showed significant 
      changes in metabolic parameters: OVR increased lipid catabolism in perirenal WAT 
      and basal lipolysis in subcutaneous WAT, while liraglutide treatment enhanced 
      stimulated lipolysis in subcutaneous WAT. Liver responses included increased 
      stimulated lipolysis with liraglutide. Transcriptome analysis revealed distinct 
      gene expression patterns in WAT of OVR rats and those treated with GLP-1RA, 
      highlighting pathways related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Functional 
      enrichment analysis showed estrogen's pivotal role in these pathways, influencing 
      genes involved in lipid metabolism regulation. Overall, the study underscores 
      GLP-1RA acting directly on adipose tissues and highlights the complex

      of diabetes and results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. Over ten 
      dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory drugs have been developed and 
      marketed around the world in the past decade. However, owing to the reported 
      adverse effects of the synthetic DPP-IV inhibitors, attempts have been made to 
      find DPP-IV inhibitors from natural sources. Food-derived components, such as 
      protein hydrolysates (peptides), have been suggested as potential DPP-IV 
      inhibitors which can help manage blood glucose levels. This review focuses on the

      the presence of Ca(2+) . These helical NG nanofibers functioned as a coating 
      layer on the surface of Ca(2+) -linked alginate (Alg) microgels for the effective

      the intestinal tract synergistically maintain a relatively normal blood glucose 
      level in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice after oral administration of

      (T2DM)-related hyperglycemia and β-cell apoptosis in rats induced by high fat 
      diet and low doses of streptozotocin and its therapeutic mechanisms. METHODS: 
      Groups of T2DM rats were treated with OMSS or bovine serum albumin (3.0 g/kg/d) 
      for 4 wk and their blood samples, together with those of normal control rats, 
      were collected before and 4 wk after treatment. The levels of fasting blood

Marine drugs,2024,"Mechanism of Takifugu bimaculatus Skin Peptides in Alleviating Hyperglycemia in 
      Rats with Type 2 Diabetic Mellitus Based on Microbiome and Metabolome Analyses.
","In this study, we aimed to explore the hypoglycemic effects of a hydrolysate on 
      Takifugu bimaculatus skin (TBSH). The effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV 
      (DPP-IV) inhibitory activities from different TBSH fractions was investigated on 
      basic indexes, gut hormones, blood lipid indexes, viscera, and the gut microbiota 
      and its metabolites in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results 
      showed that the <1 kDa peptide fraction from TBSH (TBP) exhibited a more potent 
      DPP-IV inhibitory effect (IC(50) = 0.45 ± 0.01 mg/mL). T2DM rats were induced 
      with streptozocin, followed by the administration of TBP. The 200 mg/kg TBP 
      mitigated weight loss, lowered fasting blood glucose levels, and increased 
      insulin secretion by 20.47%, 25.23%, and 34.55%, respectively, rectified 
      irregular hormonal fluctuations, lipid metabolism, and tissue injuries, and 
      effectively remedied gut microbiota imbalance. In conclusion, TBP exerts a 
      hypoglycemic effect in rats with T2DM. This study offers the potential to develop 
      nutritional supplements to treat T2DM and further promote the high-value 
      utilization of processing byproducts from T. bimaculatus. It will provide

Diabetologia,2015,"Polyphenol-rich diets improve glucose metabolism in people at high 
      cardiometabolic risk: a controlled randomised intervention trial.","AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary polyphenols and long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids (LCn3) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. This may relate to 
      their influence on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. We evaluated the effects 
      of diets naturally rich in polyphenols and/or LCn3 of marine origin on glucose 
      metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk. METHODS: According to a 2 × 2 
      factorial design, individuals with high waist circumference and at least one more 
      component of the metabolic syndrome were recruited at the obesity outpatient 
      clinic. Eighty-six participants were randomly assigned by MINIM software to an 
      isoenergetic diet: (1) control, low in LCn3 and polyphenol (analysed n = 20); (2) 
      rich in LCn3 (n = 19); (3) rich in polyphenols (n = 19); or (4) rich in LCn3 and 
      polyphenols (n = 19). The assigned diets were known for the participants and 
      blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after the 8 week intervention, 
      participants underwent a 3 h OGTT and a test meal with a similar composition as 
      the assigned diet for the evaluation of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like 
      peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta 
      cell function. RESULTS: During OGTT, polyphenols significantly reduced plasma 
      glucose total AUC (p = 0.038) and increased early insulin secretion (p = 0.048), 
      while LCn3 significantly reduced beta cell function (p = 0.031) (two-factor 
      ANOVA). Moreover, polyphenols improved post-challenge oral glucose insulin 
      sensitivity (OGIS; p = 0.05 vs control diet by post hoc ANOVA). At test meal, 
      LCn3 significantly reduced GLP-1 total postprandial AUC (p < 0.001; two-factor 
      ANOVA). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Diets naturally rich in polyphenols reduce 
      blood glucose response, likely by increasing early insulin secretion and insulin 
      sensitivity. These effects may favourably influence diabetes and cardiovascular 
      risk. The implications of the decrease in insulin secretion and postprandial 
      GLP-1 observed with diets rich in marine LCn3 need further clarification. TRIAL

      prolifera oligosaccharide (EPO) in age-matched streptozocin-induced diabetic 
      mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: LC-MS metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing is used to 
      identify the brain metabolites and gut microbiota, respectively. EPO could 
      significantly improve glucose metabolism and activity of total superoxide 
      dismutase in serum. It also could regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
      arginine, and inosine-related metabolic pathways in the brain of aged diabetic 
      mice. Inosine is found to enhance the relative expressions of daf-2, daf-16, and 
      skn-1 in insulin-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, EPO could alter 
      the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in mice. It could upregulate the

      to treat diabetes. However, its effects on muscle wasting due to aging are poorly 
      understood. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic potential and 
      underlying mechanism of dulaglutide in muscle wasting in aged mice. Dulaglutide 
      improved muscle mass and strength in aged mice. Histological analysis revealed 
      that the cross-sectional area of the tibialis anterior (TA) in the 
      dulaglutide-treated group was thicker than that in the vehicle group. Moreover, 
      dulaglutide increased the shift toward middle and large-sized fibers in both 
      young and aged mice compared to the vehicle. Dulaglutide increased myofiber type 
      I and type IIa in young (18.5% and 8.2%) and aged (1.8% and 19.7%) mice, 
      respectively, compared to the vehicle group. Peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial 
      biogenesis, decreased but increased by dulaglutide in aged mice. The expression 
      of atrophic factors such as myostatin, atrogin-1, and muscle RING-finger 
      protein-1 was decreased in aged mice, whereas that of the myogenic factor, MyoD, 
      was increased in both young and aged mice following dulaglutide treatment. In 
      aged mice, optic atrophy-1 (OPA-1) protein was decreased, whereas Toll-like 
      receptor-9 (TLR-9) and its targeting inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] 
      and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) were elevated in the TA and quadriceps (QD) 
      muscles. In contrast, dulaglutide administration reversed this expression 
      pattern, thereby significantly attenuating the expression of inflammatory 
      cytokines in aged mice. These data suggest that dulaglutide may exert beneficial 
      effects in the treatment of muscle wasting due to aging.",10.18632/aging.203546 ,article,PubMed,"Khin, Phyu Phyu","Hong, Yeonhee","Yeon, MyeongHoon","Lee, Dae Ho","Lee, Jong Han","Jun, Hee-Sook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Journal of materials chemistry. b,2025,Effect and mechanism of oritavancin on hIAPP amyloid formation.,"Amyloidosis of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is closely related to 
      the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and serves as both a diagnostic 
      hallmark and a key therapeutic target for T2D. In this study, we discovered that 
      oritavancin (Ori), a glycopeptide antibiotic primarily prescribed for 
      Gram-positive bacterial infections, can dose-dependently inhibit recombinant 
      hIAPP (rhIAPP) amyloid formation. Ori specifically inhibited rhIAPP amyloid 
      formation at the initial nucleation stage but didn't affect mature rhIAPP 
      fibrils. As a result, Ori reduced amyloidosis of rhIAPP induced pancreatic NIT-1 
      cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Based on the results 
      from studies involving antibiotic homologues of Ori and its acid hydrolysates, we 
      demonstrated that both the N-(4-chlorobiphenyl) methyl group (CBP) and 
      glycopeptide backbone were necessary for inhibiting rhIAPP amyloid formation. The 
      mechanism behind Ori on rhIAPP amyloid formation lies in the direct interaction 
      of the two molecules identified by ESI-MS and molecular docking assays. 
      Consequently, this research not only lays the groundwork for developing novel 
      therapeutic approaches for T2D but also presents the opportunity to repurpose Ori 
      as a treatment option.",10.1039/d4tb02215g ,article,PubMed,"Wang, Sheng-Nan","Li, Xin-Yu","Lu, Zhong-Xia","Liu, Lu-Xin","Xu, Xuan-Ping","Yu, Wen-Gong","Lu, Xin-Zhi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heliyon,2024,"Lactoferrin's role in modulating NF-κB pathway to alleviate diabetes-associated 
      inflammation: A novel in-silico study.","Lactoferrin (LF), a multifunctional glycoprotein found in mammalian milk and 
      various exocrine secretions, plays a pivotal role in modulating various 
      responses. Lactoferrin plays a significant role in type-2 diabetes by improving 
      hepatic insulin resistance and pancreatic dysfunction however, the exact 
      mechanism for this improvement is not thoroughly elucidated. To this date, there 
      are no evidence that attributes the direct interaction of lactoferrin with 
      components of NF-κB pathway. Considering this precedent, the current study aimed 
      to investigate the interaction of LF with key components of NF-κB pathway using 
      molecular docking and simulation approaches. Results indicated that LF has shown 
      highly stable interactions with IL-1β, IL-6, IκBα and NF-κB, and relatively 
      weaker interactions with IKK and TNF-α. All four trajectories, including root 
      mean square of deviations (RMSD), root mean square of fluctuation (RMSF), 
      hydrogen bond interactions, and radius of gyration (RoG), confirmed the stable 
      interactions of LF with NF-κB pathway components. Molecular Mechanics/Generalized 
      Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis further supports their stable interactions. 
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide convincing 
      evidence that LF can interact with all six major components of the NF-κB pathway. 
      This study provides pioneering in-silico evidence that lactoferrin (LF) can 
      interact with all six major components of the NF-κB pathway, demonstrating highly 
      stable interactions with IL-1β, IL-6, IκBα, and NF-κB, and relatively weaker 
      interactions with IKK and TNF-α. These findings suggest that LF and its peptides

      targeting the NF-κB pathway to inhibit inflammation, thereby improving insulin 
      sensitivity and aiding in the management of diabetes.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34051 ,article,PubMed,"Arain, Muhammad Asif","Khaskheli, Gul Bahar","Barham, Ghulam Shabir","Marghazani, Illahi Bakhsh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frontiers in nutrition,2023,"Pea protein hydrolysate reduces blood glucose in high-fat diet and 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.","INTRODUCTION: Food proteins have been recognized as an ideal source to release 
      bioactive peptides with the potential to intervene nutrition related chronic 
      diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. Our previous 
      studies showed that pea protein hydrolysate (PPH) could suppress hepatic glucose 
      production in hepatic cells via inhibiting the gluconeogenic signaling. Thus, we 
      hypothesized that PPH could play the hypoglycemic role in vivo. METHODS: In the 
      present study, the mice model with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) was developed 
      by high-fat diet and low dose of streptozotocin injections. PPH was administered 
      orally with a dosage of 1000 mg/kg body weight for 9 weeks, followed by the 
      downstream biomedical analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that the 9-week 
      treatment of PPH could reduce fasting blood glucose by 29.6% and improve glucose 
      tolerance in the T2DM mice. The associated mechanisms included suppression of the 
      gluconeogenic pathway, activation of the insulin signaling and modulation of the 
      renin angiotensin system in the liver of the diabetic mice. In addition, the 
      levels of pro-inflammatory markers in both liver and serum were reduced by the 
      PPH treatment. CONCLUSION: The hypoglycemic effect of PPH in T2DM mice was 
      demonstrated in the present study. Findings from this study could provide 
      rationale to incorporate PPH into functional foods or nutraceuticals for glycemic 
      control.",10.3389/fnut.2023.1298046 ,article,PubMed,"Liao, Wang","Cao, Xinyi","Xia, Hui","Wang, Shaokang","Chen, Liang","Sun, Guiju",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Advances in neurobiology,2023,"Nanowired Delivery of Cerebrolysin with Mesenchymal Stem Cells Attenuates Heat

      prominent causes of multidimensional insults to the central nervous and other 
      vital organs injury. Several military personnel suffered from bBI during the 
      Middle East conflict at hot environment. The bBI largely occurs due to pressure 
      waves, generation of heat together with release of shrapnel and gun powders 
      explosion with penetrating and/or impact head trauma causing multiple brain 
      damage. As a result, bBI-induced secondary injury causes breakdown of the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) and edema formation that further results in neuronal, 
      glial and axonal injuries. Previously, we reported endocrine imbalance and 
      influence of diabetes on bBI-induced brain pathology that was significantly 
      attenuated by nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin in model experiments. 
      Cerebrolysin is a balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors, and 
      active peptide fragment is capable of neuroprotection in several neurological 
      insults. Exposure to heat stress alone causes BBB damage, edema formation and 
      brain pathology. Thus, it is quite likely that hot environment further 
      exacerbates the consequences of bBI. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies using 
      nanodelivery of stem cell and cerebrolysin may further enhance superior 
      neuroprotection in bBI at hot environment. Our observations are the first to show 
      that combined nanowired delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and 
      cerebrolysin significantly attenuated exacerbation of bBI in hot environment and

      investigation, including the contribution of alterations in bile acids (BAs) in 
      achieving or maintaining the beneficial metabolic effects after bariatric

      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to explore the effect of the 
      interaction between potential probiotics and bitter gourd extract (BGE) or 
      mulberry leaf extract (MLE) on T2DM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Potential probiotics 
      were tested for their gastrointestinal tract viability and growth situation 
      combined with BGE and MLE in vitro. The diabetes model was constructed in C57BL/6 
      mice, and the potential effect and mechanism of regulating blood glucose were

      landscape of APP processing.","The progressive aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is a major trait of 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Aβ is produced as a result of proteolytic processing of 
      the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Processing of APP is mediated by multiple 
      enzymes, resulting in the production of distinct peptide products: the 
      non-amyloidogenic peptide sAPPα and the amyloidogenic peptides sAPPβ, Aβ40, and 
      Aβ42. Using a pathway-based approach, we analyzed a large-scale siRNA screen that

","Human amylin or islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is synthesized in the 
      pancreatic β-cells and has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) in vitro and in vivo. This study compared amylin 
      oligomerization/expression and signal transduction under endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) stress and oxidative stress. pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing INS-1E cells 
      presented different patterns of amylin oligomerization/expression under ER stress 
      and oxidative stress. Amylin oligomerization/expression under ER stress showed 
      three amylin oligomers of less than 15 kDa size in pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing 
      cells, while one band was detected under oxidative stress. Under ER stress 
      conditions, HIF1α, p-ERK, CHOP, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Bax were significantly increased 
      in pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing cells compared to the pCMV-Entry-expressing cells 
      (control), whereas p-Akt, p-mTOR, Mn-SOD, catalase, and Bcl-2 were significantly 
      decreased. Under oxidative stress conditions, HIF1α, p-ERK, CHOP, Mn-SOD, 
      catalase, and Bcl-2 were significantly reduced in pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing cells 
      compared to the control, whereas p-mTOR, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Bax were significantly

      complex I and complex IV were significantly decreased under ER stress conditions 
      and significantly increased under oxidative stress conditions in 
      pCMV-hIAPP-overexpressing cells compared to the control. The present study

Frontiers in physiology,2018,The Case Study of Nesfatin-1 in the Pancreas of Tursiops truncatus.,"Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is an anorexigenic peptide involved in the regulation of 
      homeostatic feeding. Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other 
      organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from 
      β-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in 
      metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it 
      has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully 
      replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and 
      maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This 
      correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating 
      physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized 
      Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops 
      truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and 
      post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the 
      University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four 
      animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. 
      Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were 
      distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in α-cells. Similar 
      to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically 
      significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the 
      other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the 
      main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the 
      involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.",10.3389/fphys.2018.01845 ,article,PubMed,"Gatta, Claudia","De Felice, Elena","D'Angelo, Livia","Maruccio, Lucianna","Leggieri, Adele","Lucini, Carla","Palladino, Antonio","Paolucci, Marina","Scocco, Paola","Varricchio, Ettore","de Girolamo, Paolo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      contraindicated in those with <1-year life expectancy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to develop a risk prediction score for 1-year mortality in 
      patients with primary prevention ICDs and to determine the incremental 
      improvement in discrimination when serum-based biomarkers are added to 
      traditional clinical variables. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Prospective 
      Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators, a large 
      prospective observational study of patients undergoing primary prevention ICD 
      implantation who were extensively phenotyped for clinical and serum-based 
      biomarkers. We identified variables predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized 
      them into a comprehensive risk scoring construct using backward selection. 
      RESULTS: Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a 
      reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD 
      implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New 
      York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good 
      discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 
      biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 
      and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients 
      with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 2.7%, 
      16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Individuals with more comorbidities 
      and elevation of specific serum biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause 
      mortality despite being deemed as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A 
      simple risk score composed of readily available clinical data and serum

      (UU) by high temperature/pressure and ultra-wave assisted lysis on erectile 
      dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty 
      12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Diabetes was induced by 
      a one-time intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50mg/kg). One week later, 
      the diabetic rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, 
      untreated diabetes control, and groups treated with 100 or 500mg/kg/d UU peptide. 
      Rats were fed with UU peptide by intragastric administration for 8 weeks. After 8 
      weeks, penile hemodynamic function was evaluated in all groups by measuring the 
      intracavernosal pressure after electrostimulating the cavernous nerve. Nitric

      study. METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes on diet therapy were 
      recruited from an outpatient clinic (22 men and 8 women aged 59.10 ± 13.24 years, 
      body mass index: 25.18 ± 3.88, hemoglobin A1c: 7.04 ± 1.24%). They were divided

      received fucoidan for 12 weeks (a daily 60 mL test beverage containing 1,620 mg 
      of fucoidan) and then placebo (60 mL) for the subsequent 12-week period, while 
      the order was reversed in the other group. Evaluation was performed just before 
      and after each intervention. Taste sensitivity was measured for 5 basic tastes by 
      the filter paper disk method and food intake was evaluated with a validated diet 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: No adverse events occurred during the study period. 
      Despite no change of the diet, stool frequency increased during fucoidan intake

      [Fresenius Kabi, Halden, Norway], total of 384 mL) was compared with a similar 
      lipid infusion partly replaced by Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi) that contributed a 
      median of 0.1 g fish oil per kilogram body weight, amounting to 0.04 g/kg of 
      marine n-3 FA. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic 
      clamps; insulin secretion (measured after the clamps), by C-peptide glucagon 
      tests; and energy metabolism, by indirect calorimetry. Infusion of Omegaven 
      increased the proportion of n-3 FA in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) 
      compared with Intralipid alone (20:5n-3: median, 1.5% [interquartile range, 0.6%] 
      vs -0.2% [0.2%], P = .001; 22:6n-3: 0.8% [0.4%] vs -0.7% [0.2%], P = .001). 
      However, glucose utilization was not affected; neither was insulin secretion or 
      total energy production (P = .966, .210, and .423, respectively, for the 
      differences between the lipid clamps). Omegaven tended to lower oxidation of fat 
      (P = .062) compared with Intralipid only, correlating with the rise in individual 
      n-3 NEFA (r = 0.627, P = .039). The effects of clamping on phospholipid FA 
      composition, leptin, adiponectin, or F(2)-isoprostane concentrations were not 
      affected by Omegaven. Enrichment of NEFA with n-3 FA during a 4-hour infusion of 
      Intralipid failed to affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or markers of 
      oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",10.1016/j.metabol.2009.06.003 ,article,PubMed,"Mostad, Ingrid L","Bjerve, Kristian S","Basu, Samar","Sutton, Pauline","Frayn, Keith N","Grill, Valdemar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2018,"Investigating inhibitory activity of novel synthetic sericin peptide on 
      α-D-glucosidase: kinetics and interaction mechanism study using a docking 
      simulation.","BACKGROUND: We synthesised a novel sericin peptide (SP-GI) with α-d-glucosidase 
      inhibitory activity, which has a sequence of SEDSSEVDIDLGN. The kinetics of its 
      peptide-induced inhibition on α-d-glucosidase activity and its interaction 
      mechanism merging with molecular docking were both investigated. RESULTS: SP-GI 
      exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC(50) of 2.9 ± 0.1 µmol L(-1) 
      and this inhibition was reversible and non-competitive with a K(i) value of 
      1.0 ± 0.1 µmol L(-1) . An interaction study with SP-GI revealed it bound to 
      α-d-glucosidase at a single binding site, resulting in alterations in 
      α-d-glucosidase secondary structure. This led to quenching of intrinsic 
      α-d-glucosidase fluorescence by a static quenching mechanism. Molecular docking 
      results showed that the SP-GI binding site on α-d-glucosidase differed from 
      acarbose, with hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces being the main binding 
      drivers. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the potential use for SP-GI or other 
      natural sericin peptides as dietary supplements for the treatment of type 2

Marine drugs,2022,An Octopus-Derived Peptide with Antidiuretic Activity in Rats,"Discovering new drug candidates with high efficacy and few side effects is a major challenge in new drug development. The two evolutionarily related peptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to be associated with a variety of physiological and psychological processes via the association of OXT with three types of AVP receptors. Over decades, many synthetic analogs of these peptides have been designed and tested for therapeutic applications; however, only a few studies of their natural analogs have been performed. In this study, we investigated the bioactivity and usefulness of two natural OXT/AVP analogs that originate from the marine invertebrate Octopus vulgaris, named octopressin (OTP) and cephalotocin (CPT). By measuring the intracellular Ca2+ or cyclic AMP increase in each OXT/AVP receptor subtype–overexpressing cell, we found that CPT, but not OTP, acts as a selective agonist of human AVP type 1b and 2 receptors. This behavior is reminiscent of desmopressin, the most widely prescribed antidiuretic drug in the world. Similar to the case for desmopressin, a single intravenous tail injection of CPT into Sprague-Dawley rats reduced urine output and increased urinary osmolality. In conclusion, we suggest that CPT has a significant antidiuretic effect and that CPT might be beneficial for treating urological conditions such as nocturia, enuresis, and diabetes insipidus. © 2022 by the authors.

Advanced structured materials,2021,Biological Activities of Marine Products and Nutritional Importance,"Bioactive compounds, also known as phyto-nutrients are those compounds which enhance or we can say that promote good health. They are found in a limited amount in plants, animals, marine, and other natural food sources which help in the prevention of many diseases e.g. cancers, cardiac disorders, diabetes, etc. It is well known to us that nearly half of the worldwide biodiversity is constituted by different types of marine species and as a result, oceans, sea are enriched with valuable natural bioactive compounds such as proteins, peptides, amino acids, fatty acids, sterols, oligosaccharides, vitamins, and minerals, etc. These agents also help to enhance the nutritional as well as the therapeutic value of the food products. Every year nearly thousands of new compounds are isolated from a marine organism which further help in the discovery of new leads for the development of new drugs to treat or diagnose human diseases like cancer, viral diseases, inflammation, etc. For example, thyrsiferol, which is isolated from marine red algae (genus: Laurencia) on the experimental studies shows potent anti-viral and anti-tumour activities. Another example is marine sponge (genus: Insignia) which is a good source of terpenoids consisting of tetronic acids which act as anti-inflammatory agent, analgesic, and antibiotics. There are numerous examples of such marine products that are enriched with nutritional values and show many potent biological activities. In this article, we are going to discuss different marine products one by one with their biological and nutritional importances and also their role in the development of new drugs in the treatment of various human diseases. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-54027-2_17,chapter,SCOPUS,"Pal, Dilipkumar","Raj, Khushboo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are a rich source of protein, dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals as well as polyphenols, peptides, sterols, PUFA, etc. Seaweeds are a major part of the diet of Southeast Asian countries as well as in parts of Europe, America and Australia. Apart from being a major nutrition source in the human diet, traditional Chinese medicine approves of edible seaweeds having medicinal properties. In recent times, edible algae are being marketed as a rich source of nutraceuticals for their bioactive properties. It has been established that bioactive compounds have a major therapeutic role in the management of a number of human metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc. Researchers are trying to discover newer bioactive molecules from different sources. Marine life constitutes around 80% of the world biota and edible algae is a major marine flora that can be explored to derive many bioactive compounds and other secondary metabolites for therapeutic applications through optimized harvesting, extraction and recovery for active molecules. The algal bioactive molecules have been widely reviewed to possess antiparasitic, antiinflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant and antidiabetic properties.

Molecular medicine reports,2017,Marine collagen peptides reduce endothelial cell injury in diabetic rats by inhibiting apoptosis and the expression of coupling factor 6 and microparticles,"The present study aimed to elucidate the role of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) in protection of carotid artery vascular endothelial cells (CAVECs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mechanism underlying this process. In an in vivo experiment, diabetic Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups (n=10/group): Diabetes control, and three diabetes groups administered low, medium and high doses of MCPs (2.25, 4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively). Another 10 healthy rats served as the control. In an in vitro experiment, human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in normal and high concentrations of glucose with or without MCPs (3.0, 15.0 and 30.0 mg/ml, respectively) for 24, 48 or 72 h. Blood vessel/endothelial construction, inflammatory exudation and associated molecular biomarkers in CAVECs were detected and analyzed. The results of the present study demonstrated that in rats, MCP treatment for 4 weeks significantly lowered blood glucose and attenuated endothelial thinning and inflammatory exudation in carotid-artery vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, the high-glucose intervention significantly increased cell apoptosis in HUVECs, and medium and high doses of MCPs (4.5 and 9.0 g/kg body weight/day, respectively) partially ameliorated this high glucose-mediated apoptosis and decreased levels of apoptosis biomarkers. In conclusion, a moderate oral MCP dose (>4.5 g/kg body weight/day) may be a novel therapeutic tool to protect against early cardiovascular complications associated with T2DM by inhibiting apoptosis and reducing the expression of coupling factor 6 and microparticles.",10.3892/mmr.2017.7061,article,SCOPUS,"Zhu, Cuifeng","Zhang, Wei","Liu, Jianguo","Mu, Bo","Zhang, Fan","Lai, Nannan","Zhou, Jianxin","Xu, Aimin","Li, Yong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,"Beneficial effects of fish and fish peptides on main metabolic syndrome associated risk factors: Diabetes, obesity and lipemia","The definition of metabolic syndrome (MetS) fairly varies from one to another guideline and health organization. Per description of world health organization, occurrence of hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia in addition to two or more factors of dyslipidemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypertension and or large waist circumference factors would be defined as MetS. Conventional therapies and drugs, commonly with adverse effects, are used to treat these conditions and diseases. Nonetheless, in the recent decades scientific community has focused on the discovery of natural compounds to diminish the side effects of these medications. Among many available bioactives, biologically active peptides have notable beneficial effects on the management of diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Marine inclusive of fish peptides have exerted significant bioactivities in different experimental in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical settings. This review exclusively focuses on studies from the recent decade investigating hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, hypercholesterolemic and anti-obesogenic fish and fish peptides. Related extraction, isolation, and purification methodologies of anti-MetS fish biopeptides are reviewed herein for comparison purposes only. Moreover, performance of biopeptides in simulated gastrointestinal environment and structure-activity relationship along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of selected oligopeptides have been discussed, in brief, to broaden the knowledge of readers on the design and discovery trends of anti-MetS compounds.

"Protein digestion-derived peptides: chemistry, bioactivity, and health effects",2024,Bioactive peptides released from seaweeds during gastrointestinal digestion,"Macroalgae are sustainable and natural sources of proteins, their content may reach values up to 40% of their total weight. Besides, they are especially attractive for their rich and abundant amount of essential amino acids with proportions of 30%–40% which are comparable to other terrestrial organisms, such as legumes. Hence, protein from macroalgae is a highly valuable resource that can be used as food ingredients but also as a matrix to obtain protein hydrolysates (PHs) and so bioactive peptides (BAPs). Hydrolyzation usually implies a pretreatment of the macroalgae to later apply a chemical or biological hydrolyzation followed by purification. The laborious procedure to obtain PHs and BAPs has been demonstrated to be profitable since it implies an improvement in the associated biological properties when compared to the untreated proteins. Among the enhanced qualities, PHs and BAPs have high digestibility ranges (~80%) which was related to better bioaccessibility and so to improved bioactivities. Among them, antioxidant, antiobesity, antidiabetic, hypotensive, and antiinflammatory stand out and, even though antiplatelet or anticancer have been scarcely explored, they have been proven too. Therefore the high content and quality of macroalgae proteins point to these marine organisms as a valuable source to obtain PHs and BAPs with huge potential to design functional products aimed to improve health status or prevent the development of chronic and global ailments, such as obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases, which strongly impact in the human well-being. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Nutrients,2021,Edible microalgae and their bioactive compounds in the prevention and treatment of metabolic alterations,"Marine and freshwater algae and their products are in growing demand worldwide because of their nutritional and functional properties. Microalgae (unicellular algae) will constitute one of the major foods of the future for nutritional and environmental reasons. They are sources of high-quality protein and bioactive molecules with potential application in the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes. They may also contribute decisively to sustainability through carbon dioxide fixation and minimization of agricultural land use. This paper reviews current knowledge of the effects of consuming edible microalgae on the metabolic alterations known as metabolic syndrome (MS). These microalgae include Chlorella, Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Tetraselmis as well as Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis as candidates for human consumption. Chlorella biomass has shown antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects in humans and other mammals. The components of microalgae reviewed suggest that they may be effective against MS at two levels: in the early stages, to work against the development of insulin resistance (IR), and later, when pancreatic-cell function is already compromised. The active components at both stages are antioxidant scavengers and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as carotenoids and-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid; EPA/DHA), prebiotic polysaccharides, phenolics, antihypertensive peptides, several pigments such as phycobilins and phycocyanin, and some vitamins, such as folate. As a source of high-quality protein, including an array of bioactive molecules with potential activity against the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes, microalgae are proposed as excellent foods for the future. Moreover, their incorporation into the human diet would decisively contribute to a more sustainable world because of their roles in carbon dioxide fixation and reducing the use of land for agricultural purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of food science and technology,2017,Effects of marine collagen peptides on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats,"The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance using a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Forty T2DM obese Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of MCPs or a vehicle control for 4 weeks. Blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation were measured. The expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscles and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) in livers of T2DM rats was also measured. It was found that in the group of 9.0 g/kg/day MCPs significantly improved glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and increased the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). In addition, the groups of 4.5 and 2.25 g/kg/day MCPs significantly improved liver steatosis. It was also found that MCPs decreased expression of oxidative stress biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines in T2DM rats. In conclusion, medium and high doses of MCPs (≥4.5 g/kg/day) improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in T2DM rats. These beneficial effects of MCPs may be mediated by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation and by up-regulating GLUT4, and PPAR-α activity. © 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).",10.1007/s13197-017-2663-z,article,SCOPUS,"Zhu, Cui Feng","Zhang, Wei","Mu, Bo","Zhang, Fan","Lai, Nan Nan","Zhou, Jian Xin","Xu, Ai Min","Liu, Jian Guo","Li, Yong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recent advances in micro and macroalgal processing: food and health perspectives,2021,Role of Algal Derived Compounds in Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics,"Macro- and microalgae contain a variety of biologically active compounds that are of great interest in the prevention of diseases and therefore are potential candidates for the development of pharmaceutical preparations, either as medicines or as nutraceuticals. Some epidemiological studies indicate that consumption of algae can protect from certain diseases such as allergies, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, atopic dermatitis, or Alzheimer’s disease, and this has led to in vitro and in vivo studies, to research their possible mechanisms of action. Even though clinical trials are scarce, the pharmaceutical industry is keen on developing drugs of natural origin from marine organisms (e.g. Adcetris®), with fewer side effects or less toxicity to humans. Macro- and microalgae contain a variety of bioactive compounds: polysaccharides; phenolic compounds such as phlorotannins; diverse pigments such as the chlorophylls and carotenoids, including fucoxanthin; mycosporine-like amino acids; halogenated compounds; proteins, peptides, and amino acids; essential and long-chain marine polyunsaturated fatty acids; sterols; and other lipids, vitamins, and minerals that could be putative active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.

Cardiovascular diabetology,2024,Biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis and incident type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: results from the Vitamin D and Omega-3 trial,"Background: Dysglycemia and insulin resistance increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet associations with specific glucose-insulin homeostatic biomarkers have been inconsistent. Vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may improve insulin resistance. We sought to examine the association between baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and a novel insulin resistance score (IRS) with incident cardiometabolic diseases, and whether randomized vitamin D or n-3 FA modify these associations. Methods: VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (NCT01169259) was a randomized clinical trial testing vitamin D and n-3 FA for the prevention of CVD and cancer over a median of 5.3 years. Incident cases of T2D and CVD (including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) were matched 1:1 on age, sex, and fasting status to controls. Conditional logistic regressions adjusted for demographic, clinical, and adiposity-related factors were used to assess the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per-standard deviation (SD) and 95%CI of baseline insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and IRS (Insulin×0.0295 + C-peptide×0.00372) with risk of T2D, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: We identified 218 T2D case-control pairs and 715 CVD case-control pairs including 423 with incident CHD. Each of the four biomarkers at baseline was separately associated with incident T2D, aOR (95%CI) per SD increment: insulin 1.46 (1.03, 2.06), C-peptide 2.04 (1.35, 3.09), IRS 1.72 (1.28, 2.31) and HbA1c 7.00 (3.76, 13.02), though only HbA1c remained statistically significant with mutual adjustments. For cardiovascular diseases, we only observed significant associations of HbA1c with CVD (1.19 [1.02, 1.39]), and IRS with CHD (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]), which persisted after mutual adjustment. Randomization to vitamin D and/or n-3 FA did not modify the association of these biomarkers with the endpoints. Conclusions: Each of insulin, C-peptide, IRS, and HbA1c were associated with incident T2D with the strongest association noted for HbA1c. While HbA1c was significantly associated with CVD risk, a novel IRS appears to be associated with CHD risk. Neither vitamin D nor n-3 FA modified the associations between these biomarkers and cardiometabolic outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1186/s12933-024-02470-1,article,SCOPUS,"Qian, Frank","Guo, Yanjun","Li, Chunying","Liu, Yanyan","Luttmann-Gibson, Heike","Gomelskaya, Natalya","Demler, Olga V.","Cook, Nancy R.","Lee, I-Min","Buring, Julie E.","Larsen, Julia","Boring, Jennifer","McPhaul, Michael J.","Manson, JoAnn E.","Pradhan, Aruna D.","Mora, Samia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2023,Antidiabetic Effect of Collagen Peptides from Harpadon nehereus Bones in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes Mice by Regulating Oxidative Stress and Glucose Metabolism,"Oxidative stress and abnormal glucose metabolism are the important physiological mechanisms in the occurrence and development of diabetes. Antioxidant peptides have been reported to attenuate diabetes complications by regulating levels of oxidative stress, but few studies have focused on peptides from marine bone collagen. In this study, we prepared the peptides with a molecular weight of less than 1 kD (HNCP) by enzymolysis and ultrafiltration derived from Harpadon nehereus bone collagen. Furthermore, the effects of HNCP on blood glucose, blood lipid, liver structure and function, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism were studied using HE staining, kit detection, and Western blotting experiment in streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. After the 240 mg/kg HNCP treatment, the levels of blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mice decreased by 32.8%, 42.2%, and 43.2%, respectively, while the levels of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen increased by 142.0% and 96.4%, respectively. The antioxidant enzymes levels and liver function in the diabetic mice were markedly improved after HNCP intervention. In addition, the levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glucokinase (GK), and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (p-GSK3β) in the liver were markedly up-regulated after HNCP treatment, but the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PEPCK1) were down-regulated. In conclusion, HNCP could attenuate oxidative stress, reduce blood glucose, and improve glycolipid metabolism in streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/md21100518,article,SCOPUS,"Lin, Qianxia","Guo, Yueping","Li, Jie","He, Shuqi","Chen, Yan","Jin, Huoxi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Journal of functional foods,2018,Bioactive compounds and biological functions of sea cucumbers as potential functional foods,"Sea cucumbers are a group of economically important invertebrate marine animals that have been widely used as tonic foods in Asia countries.

This review is to provide a comprehensive and most recent update of these biological functions and their associated bioactive compounds. The management practice to keep sustainable sea cucumbers including natural stock fishery and aquaculture were discussed. The extraction and purification of the bioactive compounds were also summarized, providing a perspective of preparing sea cucumber derived nutraceuticals.

Biomolecules,2024,Metabolites from Marine Macroorganisms of the Red Sea Acting as Promoters or Inhibitors of Amylin Aggregation,"Amylin is part of the endocrine pancreatic system that contributes to glycemic control, regulating blood glucose levels. However, human amylin has a high tendency to aggregate, forming isolated amylin deposits that are observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In search of new inhibitors of amylin aggregation, we undertook the chemical analyses of five marine macroorganisms encountered in high populations in the Red Sea and selected a panel of 10 metabolites belonging to different chemical classes to evaluate their ability to inhibit the formation of amyloid deposits in the human amylin peptide. The thioflavin T assay was used to examine the kinetics of amyloid aggregation, and atomic force microscopy was employed to conduct a thorough morphological examination of the formed fibrils. The potential ability of these compounds to interact with the backbone of peptides and compete with β-sheet formation was analyzed by quantum calculations, and the interactions with the amylin peptide were computationally examined using molecular docking. Despite their structural similarity, it could be observed that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of pyrrolidinones 9 and 10 with the protein sheets result in one case in a stable aggregation, while in the other, they cause distortion from aggregation. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/biom14080951,article,SCOPUS,"Alghrably, Mawadda","Tammam, Mohamed A.","Koutsaviti, Aikaterini","Roussis, Vassilios","Lopez, Xabier","Bennici, Giulia","Sharfalddin, Abeer","Almahasheer, Hanan","Duarte, Carlos M.","Emwas, Abdul-Hamid","Ioannou, Efstathia","Jaremko, Mariusz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2024,Effects of Marine-Derived Components on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and Gut Microbiota Diversity,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which comprise coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, collectively represent the number one cause of death globally. Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human inflammatory disease.

Frontiers in nutrition,2019,Peptides and peptidomimetics as potential antiobesity agents: Overview of current status,"There is a high occurrence of obesity worldwide without many new medications being approved for its treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce new approaches for treating obesity. Bioactive peptides have been used to treat metabolic disorders- such as type-2 diabetes and obesity; while also possessing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-viral properties. However, the development of these peptides has taken backstage due to their size, reduced stability, poor delivery and bioavailability, fast rate of degradation etc. But with the emergence of newer techniques for multifunctional peptides, mimetics, peptide analogs, and aptamers, there is a sudden revival in this therapeutic field. An increased attention is required for development of the natural peptides from food and marine sources which can mimic the function of mediators involved in weight management to avoid obesity. Herein, the search for the structures of anti-obesity peptides was carried out in order to establish their potential for drug development in future. An extensive search for the current status of endogenous, food and marine peptides, with reference to novel and interesting experimental approaches based on peptidomimetics for controlling obesity, was performed. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-specific agonist, GLP-1 dual and triple agonists, neuropeptides and prolactin-releasing peptide mimetics were specifically examined for their anti-obesity role. Novel peptides, mimetics, and synthesis interventions are transpiring and might offer safer alternatives for otherwise scarcely available safe antiobesity drug. A deeper understanding of peptides and their chemistry through the use of peptide engineering can be useful to overcome the disadvantages and select best mimetics and analogs for treatment in future. © 2019 Kumar.",10.3389/fnut.2019.00011,survey,SCOPUS,"Kumar, Maushmi S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrients,2024,Proteins and Peptides Studied In Silico and In Vivo for the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review,"Bioinformatics has expedited the screening of new efficient therapeutic agents for diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM). The objective of this systematic review (SR) was to understand naturally occurring proteins and peptides studied in silico and subsequently reevaluated in vivo for treating DM, guided by the question: which peptides or proteins have been studied in silico for the treatment of diabetes mellitus? The RS protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database. Articles meeting the eligibility criteria were selected from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and EMBASE databases. Five studies that investigated peptides or proteins analyzed in silico and in vivo were selected. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the adapted Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) tool. A diverse range of assessed proteins and/or peptides that had a natural origin were investigated in silico and corresponding in vivo reevaluation demonstrated reductions in glycemia and/or insulin, morphological enhancements in pancreatic β cells, and alterations in the gene expression of markers associated with DM. The in silico studies outlined offer crucial insights into therapeutic strategies for DM, along with promising leads for screening novel therapeutic agents in future trials. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/nu16152395,review,SCOPUS,"Medeiros, Isaiane","Gomes, Ana Francisca Teixeira","Oliveira e Silva, Emilly Guedes","Bezerra, Ingrid Wilza Leal","da Silva Maia, Juliana Kelly","Piuvezam, Grasiela","Morais, Ana Heloneida de Araújo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2023,Astaxanthin: A Marine Drug That Ameliorates Cerebrovascular-Damage-Associated Alzheimer’s Disease in a Zebrafish Model via the Inhibition of Matrix Metalloprotease-13,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major type of dementia disorder. Common cognitive changes occur as a result of cerebrovascular damage (CVD) via the disruption of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). In diabetic cases, the progress of vascular dementia is faster and the AD rate is higher. Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to have a higher risk of the factor for AD progression. Hence, this study is designed to investigate the role of astaxanthin (AST) in CVD-associated AD in zebrafish via the inhibition of MMP-13 activity. CVD was developed through the intraperitoneal and intracerebral injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The AST (10 and 20 mg/L), donepezil (1 mg/L), and MMP-13 inhibitor (i.e., CL-82198; 10 μM) were exposed for 21 consecutive days in CVD animals. The cognitive changes in zebrafish were evaluated through light and dark chamber tests, a color recognition test, and a T-maze test. The biomarkers of AD pathology were assessed via the estimation of the cerebral extravasation of Evans blue, tissue nitrite, amyloid beta-peptide aggregation, MMP-13 activity, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The results revealed that exposure to AST leads to ameliorative behavioral and biochemical changes. Hence, AST can be used for the management of AD due to its multi-targeted actions, including MMP-13 inhibition. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/md21080433,article,SCOPUS,"Paramakrishnan, Nallupillai","Lim, Khian Giap","Paramaswaran, Yamunna","Ali, Nemat","Waseem, Mohammad","Shazly, Gamal A.","Bin Jardan, Yousef A.","Muthuraman, Arunachalam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applied phycology,2021,Profiling the activity of edible European macroalgae towards pharmacological targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"In traditional medicine marine extracts are extensively used as therapies for diabetes. With the increasing rate of incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and rising cost of treatments, we investigated the anti-diabetic properties of extracts of common edible seaweeds in Europe including their ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzymatic activity, block sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) activity and stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and synthesis. The most promising seaweed extracts were tested for anti-hyperglycaemic activity in vivo. Some brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) extracts had inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase ranging from 13.9 ± 0.2% to 89.5 ± 0.4% (p < 0.001). However, none of the seaweed extracts was able to block SGLT-2 activity. Ethanol extracts of the kelp Alaria esculenta and water extracts of Laminaria digitata strongly inhibited DPP-4 activity by 91.3 ± 0.1% and 90.0 ± 0.2%, respectively (p < 0.001), while ethanol extracts of Ulva rigida (Chlorophyta) had the greatest potential to stimulate GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 synthesis (p < 0.001). A water extract of Porphyra linearis (Rhodophyta) significantly reduced the overall glycaemic excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test in normal mice (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate future potential for common edible seaweeds to be used as medicinal foods or bio-therapeutics to tackle type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting GLP-1 secretion, DPP-4 activity or alpha-glucosidase activity. © 2021 The Author(s).

Biomedicine and pharmacotherapy,2022,Update of Indoles: Promising molecules for ameliorating metabolic diseases,"Obesity and metabolic disorders have gradually become public health-threatening problems. The metabolic disorder is a cluster of complex metabolic abnormalities which are featured by dysfunction in glucose and lipid metabolism, and results from the increasing prevalence of visceral obesity. With the core driving factor of insulin resistance, metabolic disorder mainly includes type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), micro and macro-vascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and the dysfunction of gut microbiota. Strategies and therapeutic attention are demanded to decrease the high risk of metabolic diseases, from lifestyle changes to drug treatment, especially herbal medicines. Indole is a parent substance of numerous bioactive compounds, and itself can be produced by tryptophan catabolism to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and inhibit the development of obesity. In addition, in heterocycles drug discovery, the indole scaffold is primarily found in natural compounds with versatile biological activity and plays a prominent role in drug molecules synthesis. In recent decades, plenty of natural or synthesized indole deriviatives have been investigated and elucidated to exert effects on regulating glucose hemeostasis and lipd metabolism. The aim of this review is to trace and emphasize the compounds containing indole scaffold that possess immense potency on preventing metabolic disorders, particularly T2DM, obesity and NAFLD, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms, therefore facilitate a better comprehension of their druggability and application in metabolic diseases. © 2022",10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112957,review,SCOPUS,"Hu, Wei","Yan, Guanyu","Ding, Qian","Cai, Jianghong","Zhang, Zhongyi","Zhao, Ziming","Lei, Heping","Zhu, Yi Zhun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bioactive compounds: health benefits and potential applications,2018,"Association Between Diet, Health, and the Presence of Bioactive Compounds in Foods","The study of associations between diet, health, and the presence of bioactive compounds in foods has received a substantial amount of attention. They are mostly concentrated in cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, peptides, omega-3, and fiber. Epidemiological studies indicate that dietary intake of fruits and cereals prevents chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Both animal and plant proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides having specific physiological and biochemical functions.

Frontiers in physiology,2018,The case study of nesfatin-1 in the pancreas of tursiops truncatus,"Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is an anorexigenic peptide involved in the regulation of homeostatic feeding. Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from β-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in α-cells. Similar to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.

Food research international,2021,"Recent developments on production, purification and biological activity of marine peptides","Marine peptides are one of the richest sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds and a considerable attention has been drawn towards their production and bioactivity. However, there is a paucity in consolidation of emerging trends encompassing both production techniques and biological application. Herein, we intend to review the recent advancements on different production, purification and identification technologies used for marine peptides along with presenting their potential health benefits. Bibliometric analysis revealed a growing number of scientific publications on marine peptides (268 documents per year) with both Asia (37.2%) and Europe (33.1%) being the major contributors. Extraction and purification by ultrafiltration and enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by identification by chromatographic techniques coupled with an appropriate detector could yield a high content of peptides with improved bioactivity. Moreover, the multifunctional health benefits exerted by marine peptides including anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-hypertension, anti-diabetes and anti-cancer along with their structure–activity relationship were presented. The future perspective on marine peptide research should focus on finding improved separation and purification technologies with enhanced selectivity and resolution for obtaining more novel peptides with high yield and low cost. In addition, by employing encapsulation strategies such as nanoemulsion and nanoliposome, oral bioavailability and bioactivity of peptides can be greatly enhanced. Also, the potential health benefits that are demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo models should be validated by conducting human clinical trials for a technology transfer from bench to bedside. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110468,review,SCOPUS,"Sridhar, Kandi","Inbaraj, Baskaran Stephen","Chen, Bing-Huei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trends in food science and technology,2020,Therapeutic potential of algal natural products against metabolic syndrome: A review of recent developments,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) defines a group of severe comorbidities, including insulin resistance, abnormal fat accumulation, and high blood pressure that lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart diseases. MS has received a growing concern due to its rising prevalence in many countries. The consumption of high-calorie food, sedentary lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and stress conditions aggravate risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome. Investigations targeting the development of marine algae-based functional food products and drug candidates for attenuating MS have presently received increased attention. Scope and approach: This review delivers an overview of recent (past ten years) advancements in discovering marine algal natural products with therapeutic potential against metabolic syndrome. Pathophysiology of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the action mechanisms of algal natural products are taken into the discussion. Key findings and conclusions: Marine algae, a popular ingredient in East Asian cuisine, is proven to be a source of nutritional and biofunctional natural products with promising ability to remedy MS. These include bioactive polyphenols, sulfated polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and peptides with vast structural diversity. Moreover, algae are rich sources of dietary fibers that decrease the absorption of excessive nutrition and increase microbial functionality in the gut. By today, numerous algae-derived food supplements could be found in the market. The public should be educated on their beneficial effects, and research needs to be advance towards pre-clinical trials targeting the development of pharmaceuticals for the preventive and effective management of MS and its associated complications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.tifs.2020.01.020,review,SCOPUS,"Fernando, Ilekuttige Priyan Shanura","Ryu, BoMi","Ahn, Ginnae","Yeo, In-Kyu","Jeon, You-Jin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iium medical journal malaysia,2025,Antidiabetic Effects of Coffee Enriched with Maca and Marine Collagen Peptide (Blackbelt®) in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Rat Model,"INTRODUCTION: The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported 463 million global cases of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2019. Lepidium meyenii (maca) and marine collagen peptide (MCP) have individually shown potential in alleviating T2DM symptoms, but their combined effects remain underexplored. This study evaluated the impact of Blackbelt® coffee, enriched with maca and MCP, on fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and pancreatic and liver histology in a T2DM rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male rats with a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with metformin, maca, MCP, Maca/MCP® (Blackbelt® formulation), or Blackbelt® coffee for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were monitored, and fasting serum insulin, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance), HOMA-B (ß-cell function), and QUICKI (insulin sensitivity) were assessed. Histological analysis of the pancreas and liver was performed using haematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, treatments significantly reduced FBG levels compared to control (p<0.05), with Blackbelt® coffee notably increasing insulin production (p<0.05). All groups showed decreased HOMA-IR (p<0.05), and both metformin and Blackbelt® coffee groups had significant HOMA-B score increases (p<0.05). Histological analysis revealed improved pancreatic health in all treated groups, with significant liver histology enhancement in the Blackbelt® coffee group. CONCLUSIONS: Blackbelt® coffee improved FBG levels, insulin resistance, and ß-cell function more effectively than maca or MCP alone, and surpassed metformin in insulin production and hepatoprotective effects. Despite its promising potential for diabetes therapy, further research is needed to understand the synergistic effects of maca and MCP and the contribution of the coffee components. © (2025), (International Islamic University Malaysia).

Marine drugs,2019,Antihypertensive and angiotensin-i-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides from fish as potential cardioprotective compounds,"The term metabolic/cardiometabolic/insulin resistance syndrome could generally be defined as the co-occurrence of several risk factors inclusive of systemic arterial hypertension. Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides. Furthermore, drug-likeness of selected biopeptides was predicted by Lipinski's rules to differentiate a drug-like biopeptide from nondrug-like one. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/md17110613,article,SCOPUS,"Abachi, Soheila","Bazinet, Laurent","Beaulieu, Lucie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veterinary world,2024,Combination of curcuminoid and collagen marine peptides for healing diabetic wounds infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,"Background and Aim: The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Indonesia indirectly reflects the high risk of developing chronic wounds that are susceptible to infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an infectious pathogen that is resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, antibiotic therapy is ineffective enough to treat chronic hyperglycemic wounds caused by MRSA infection. Curcuminoids have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects by inhibiting the enzymatic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Collagen is a tissue regeneration inducer. The combination of these two ingredients is expected to be an alternative therapy for MRSA-infected hyperglycemic chronic wounds without the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hydrolacin-gel in wound healing and inhibiting the growth of MRSA bacteria, as well as to determine the optimal concentration of curcuminoids combined with collagen marine peptides (CMPs). Materials and Methods: Hydrolacin-gels were prepared by homogenizing curcuminoid nanoemulsions and CMPs. The evaluation of preparation includes stability tests and antibacterial activity tests. Wound diabetic mice were treated with various combinations of curcuminoid and CMPs. Wound healing was observed based on malondialdehyde levels as a marker of oxidative stress and histopathological changes in the skin wound. Results: Hydrolacin-gel was formulated by combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion (more water soluble) and CMPs, with the ratio of formula 1 (1:2, curcuminoid 43.3 mg and CMPs 5.58 mg), formula 2 (1:1, curcuminoid 86.8 mg and CMPs 3.72), and formula 3 (2:1, curcuminoid 130.2 mg and CMPs 1.87 mg) calculated based on the effective dose of curcuminoid 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) and CMPs 0.9 g/kg BW. Hydrolacin-gel had a potential antibacterial activity against MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel induced wound tissue repair and reduced oxidative stress caused by inflammation in diabetic-infected MRSA. Hydrolacin-gel could be used for healing MRSA-infected diabetic wounds, especially formula 3 with the ratio of curcuminoid: CMPs = 2:1. Conclusion: Hydrolacin-gel combining curcuminoid nanoemulsion and CMPs effectively inhibited the inflammatory process and increased re-epithelialization in MRSA-infected diabetic wound healing. Hydrolacin-gel with curcuminoid (130.2 mg) and CMPs (1.87 mg) at a concentration ratio of 2:1 appeared to be the best formula against MRSA infection in diabetic wounds.

Future foods,2024,Pharmacoinformatics and cellular studies of algal peptides as functional molecules to modulate type-2 diabetes markers,"Novel dietary strategies are urgently needed to address the limitations of current management and treatment options of Type-2 Diabetes (T2D). Marine algae-derived peptides (MAP) represent a promising avenue, although, their potential remains mostly underexplored. This study employs pharmacoinformatics and in vitro methods to evaluate the antidiabetic properties of MAP and provide new insights their mechanisms to mitigate the prevalence of T2D. Through a systematic search and predictive modeling, peptides were identified and assessed for bioactivity, toxicity, and drug-likeness. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations with protein targets related to T2D identified binding sites that be used to optimize the activity of MAP. The structure-activity relationship profile of MAP reveals 13 candidates with probable activity (Pa) scores >0.4, indicative of insulin promoter. The peptide FDGIP (P13;Phe-Asp-Gly-Ile-Pro) from Caulerpa lentillifera had the best in silico assessment value compared to 50 other peptides and its activity was confirmed by in vitro data (e.g.EC50 60.4 and 57.9 for α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitions). Interestingly, in 3T3-L1 cells, P13 exhibited inhibitory activities against transcription factors and hormones (MAPK8-JNK1/PPARGC1A/Ghrelin/GLP-1/CPT-1) that can regulate blood sugar and decrease as anti-diabetes. P13 then appears to be a peptide with antidiabetic action that may be used in the formulation foods to manage T2D. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.fufo.2024.100354,article,SCOPUS,"Kurniawan, Rudy","Taslim, Nurpudji Astuti","Hardinsyah, Hardinsyah","Syauki, Andi Yasmin","Idris, Irfan","Aman, Andi Makbul","Permatasari, Happy Kurnia","Wiyarta, Elvan","Surya, Reggie","Mayulu, Nelly","Putra, Purnawan Pontana","Tjandrawinata, Raymond Rubianto","Tallei, Trina Ekawati","Kim, Bonglee","Tsopmo, Apollinaire","Nurkolis, Fahrul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to isolate and characterize marine peptides from the crustacean crab species named Scylla serrata. The hemolymph was collected and subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for identifying amine groups. Furthermore, peptide groups in the sample were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) for the crude was performed to identify peak intensities. The sample was further purified with Sephadex G-25 to elute the small molecular peptides. Antioxidant activity (DPPH) for the crude sample showed 55% of activity at 100 µg/ml concentration, and the fractions showed significant activity. The eluted fractions from the column chromatography were then subjected to SDS PAGE to identify the molecular weight of the peptides in which the peptide bands ranged between 75 and 100 kDa. Furthermore, prospective compounds must be screened for potential drug candidates for Alzheimer’s disease with an in silico approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-023-01083-x,article,SCOPUS,"Bakthavachalam, Dhivya","Arumugam, Sivakumar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naunyn-schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2025,Marine-derived bioactive compounds for neuropathic pain: pharmacology and therapeutic potential,"Neuropathic pain, a challenging condition often associated with diabetes, trauma, or chemotherapy, impairs patients’ quality of life. Current treatments often provide inconsistent relief and notable adverse effects, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review investigates marine-derived bioactive compounds as potential novel therapies for neuropathic pain management. Marine organisms, including fungi, algae, cone snails, sponges, soft corals, tunicates, and fish, produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites with significant pharmacological properties. These include peptides (e.g., conopeptides, piscidin 1), non-peptides (e.g., guanidinium toxins, astaxanthin, docosahexaenoic acid, fucoidan, apigenin, fumagillin, aaptamine, flexibilide, excavatolide B, capnellenes, austrasulfones, lemnalol), and crude extracts (e.g., Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella salina, Cliothosa aurivilli). These compounds exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, such as modulating ion channels (e.g., transient receptor potential channels, voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, and G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels), interacting with cell-surface receptors (e.g., nicotinic acetylcholine, NMDA, kainate, GABAB​, and neurotensin receptors), inhibiting norepinephrine transporters, reducing oxidative stress, and attenuating neuroinflammation. These effects collectively contribute to alleviating nerve degeneration and symptoms of neuropathic pain, including hyperalgesia, allodynia, and associated psychomotor disturbances. Marine-derived bioactive compounds represent promising alternatives to conventional neuropathic pain treatments, to advance their development and assess their integration into neuropathic pain management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",10.1007/s00210-024-03667-7,review,SCOPUS,"Mishra, Swapnil","Mishra, Yogesh","Kumar, Ashutosh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seaweeds and seaweed-derived compounds: meeting the growing need for healthy biologically active compounds,2024,Functional Properties of Seaweed on Gut Microbiota,"Since it has been linked to a variety of advantages for human health, seaweed consumption has grown in Western nations. Seaweeds are typically divided into three phylum-level groupings based on their natural pigmentation: red seaweed (Rhodophyta), brown seaweed (Phaeophyta), and green seaweed (Chlorophyta), with brown seaweed being the most prevalent. These seaweeds as, explained in the previous chapter, contains different bioactive compounds, not only due to their chemical nature, but also because marine algae produce a wide range of different metabolites to survive in extreme marine environments. Among these compounds are polysaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, different antioxidants compounds as phlorotannins and bioactive peptides. These components have shown their potential preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and even cancer. In the last years, biomedical research has led to advances in the knowledge of the gut microbiota showing that it acts in a symbiotic way with the host and playing a fundamental role in health and disease. It is clear is that a balanced microbiota is fundamental in the prevention of these pathologies. Therefore, the scientific community is in the search of new strategies or therapies for improving the composition of the gut microbiota. One of these strategies is the use of functional foods or ingredients as modulators. In this sense, the seaweed, and their components, especially, the polysaccharides, which are not absorbed in the small intestine, have arisen as potential prebiotics since these compounds seems to exert a positive effect in the gut microbiota in in vitro and in vivo animal studies.

Protein byproducts: transformation from environmental burden into value-added products,2016,Marine Processing Proteinaceous By-Products: A Source of Biofunctional Food Ingredients,"Large quantities of by-products from the fish and shellfish processing industries are generated annually. These consist of heads, bones, viscera, gills, muscle, belly flaps, and skin of different fish species, along with shells and byssus from shellfish, in addition to catch below the standard for trade. Given the rapid increase in aquaculture in the last decade, it is expected that 99.33 million tons of by-products will be generated annually by 2022. Currently, the by-products are discarded or used mainly as fertilizer or animal feed or are further processed for fish oil extraction. However, it is becoming more evident that marine processing by-products are rich reservoirs of structurally diverse biofunctional nitrogenous components, such as proteins, peptides, and amino acids. They can contain significant levels of high-quality protein (10-23% w/w) and may act as substrates for the generation of bioactive peptides. Enzymatic hydrolysis is used for modification of food proteins to improve their physicochemical, bio- and techno-functional as well as sensory properties. With the rapid increase in incidences of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, an opportunity exists to identify new marine-derived bioactive components targeted for the prevention and management of these conditions.

Usually, molecules with a possibility of use in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry are added-value products that can make microalgae large-scale production economically viable. Examples of molecules present in microalgae biomass are triglycerides rich in Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) widely studied due to the benefits to human health, including prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Some marine microalgae such as Isochrysis sp., Nannochloropsis sp. and diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum are known to exhibit high quantities of long-chain PUFA such as Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). In addition, some species show a high content of Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) on lipids, as Botryococcus braunii, which usually contains more than 50% of oleic acid. Other high-value molecules from microalgae biomass are the anti-oxidants and vitamin precursors named carotenoids, such as β-carotene, fucoxanthin, and astaxanthin. Besides lipid material, algal proteins can be used in nutrition depending on amino acid profile, as well as a source of high-value peptides. Also, polysaccharides are used as food additives as they exhibit anti-oxidant properties. This short review focused on the screening of different microalgae species to produce high-value lipids, aiming long-chain fatty acids production of industrial interest. Some aspects are considered in this work, such as biomass productivity and composition together with information on cultivation conditions. Therefore, it may help researchers and process engineers to select the adequate microalgae strain for application in large-scale plants in the food and pharmaceutical industry.

Tilapia skin peptides (TSPs) are mixtures of small-molecular-weight peptides derived from tilapia skin. Rising evidence suggests that bioactive peptides from marine sources are beneficial for DN. This study aimed to investigate whether TSPs can alleviate the pathological progress in experimental DN by improving mitochondrial dysfunction through the activation of Bnip3/Nix signaling. In the current study, TSPs treatment alleviated the metabolic parameters and renal morphology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Additionally, TSPs treatment significantly activated Bnip3/Nix signaling and improved the mitochondrial morphology, reversed the over-production of mitochondrial superoxide and cellular reactive oxygen species and the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby inhibiting the expressions of fibronectin, collagen IV and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 in glomerular mesangial cells induced by high glucose.

Journal of nutritional science,2018,Effect of a cod protein hydrolysate on postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy subjects: A double-blind cross-over trial,"The increased prevalence of lifestyle diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), calls for more knowledge on dietary treatments targeting the specific metabolic pathways involved in these conditions. Several studies have shown a protein preload before a meal to be effective in lowering the postprandial glycaemic response in healthy individuals and patients with T2DM. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy, middle-aged to elderly subjects. This double-blind cross-over trial (n 41) included two study days with 4-7 d wash-out in between. The intervention consisted of 20 mg of MPH (or casein as control) per kg body weight given before a breakfast meal. The primary outcome was postprandial response in glucose metabolism, measured by samples of serum glucose, insulin and plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in 20 min intervals for 180 min. In a mixed-model regression analysis, no differences were observed between MPH and control for postprandial glucose concentration (mean difference: -0 04 (95 % CI -0 17, 0 09) mmol/l; P = 0 573) or GLP-1 concentration (mean difference between geometric means: 1 02 (95 % CI 0 99, 1 06) pmol/l; P = 0 250). The postprandial insulin concentration was significantly lower after MPH compared with control (mean difference between geometric means: 1 067 (95 % CI 1 01, 1 13) mIU/l; P = 0 032). Our findings demonstrate that a single dose of MPH before a breakfast meal reduces postprandial insulin secretion, without affecting blood glucose response or GLP-1 levels, in healthy individuals. Further studies with repeated dosing and in target groups with abnormal glucose control are warranted. © The Author(s) 2018.",10.1017/jns.2018.23,article,SCOPUS,"Dale, Hanna Fjeldheim","Jensen, Caroline","Hausken, Trygve","Lied, Einar","Hatlebakk, Jan Gunnar","Brønstad, Ingeborg","Hoff, Dag Arne Lihaug","Lied, Gülen Arslan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Applied sciences (switzerland),2022,Therapeutic Potential of Seaweed‐Derived Bioactive Compounds for Cardiovascular Disease Treatment,"Cardiovascular diseases are closely related to hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obe-sity, and hyperlipidemia. Many studies have reported that an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are critical factors that enhance these diseases. Recently, many bioactive compounds isolated from marine seaweeds have been studied for their benefits in improving human health. In particular, several unique bioactive metabolites such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, peptides, carotene, and sterol are the most effective components responsible for these activities. This review summarizes the current in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies related to the protective effects of bioactive compounds isolated from seaweeds against cardiovascular disorders, including anti‐diabetic, anti‐hy-pertensive, anti‐hyperlipidemia, and anti‐obesity effects. Therefore, this present review summarizes these concepts and provides a basis for further in‐depth research. © 2022 by the authors.

Chemistry - a european journal,2024,Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti-Obesity Cyclic Peptide,"Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein–protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",10.1002/chem.202402049,article,SCOPUS,"Sun, Yiting","Dakiiwa, Ayumi","Zhang, Menghua","Shibata, Takahiro","Kita, Masaki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lipids in health and disease,2022,Effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on erythrocyte fatty acid composition in type 2 diabetic patients,"Background: Dietary fatty acids intake affects the composition of erythrocyte fatty acids, which is strongly correlated with glycolipid metabolism disorders. This study aimed at investigating the different effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) on the fatty acids of erythrocytes and glycolipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: The randomized double-blinded trial that was performed on 180 T2DM patients. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The fish oil (FO) group was administered with FO at a dose of 3 g/day containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the perilla oil (PO) group was administered with PO at a dose of 3 g/day containing α-linolenic (ALA), the linseed and fish oil (LFO) group was administered with mixed linseed and fish oil at a dose of 3 g/day containing EPA, DHA and ALA. Demographic information were collected and anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid metabolism indexes, erythrocyte fatty acid composition were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA. Results: A total of 150 patients finished the trial, with 52 of them in the FO group, 50 in the PO group and 48 in the LFO group. There were significant effects of time × treatment interaction on fast blood glucose (FBG), insulin, HOMA-IR and C-peptide, TC and triglyceride (TG) levels (P < 0.001). Glucose and C-peptide in PO and LFO groups decreased significantly and serum TG in FO group significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after the intervention. Erythrocyte C22: 5 n-6, ALA, DPA, n-6/n-3 PUFA, AA/EPA levels in the PO group were significantly higher than FO and LFO groups, while EPA, total n-3 PUFA and Omega-3 index were significantly higher in the FO and LFO groups compared to PO group. Conclusion: Supplementation with perilla oil decreased FBG while fish oil supplementation decreased the TG level. Marine-based and plant-based n-3 PUFAs exhibit different effects on fatty acid compositions of erythrocytes and regulated glycolipid metabolism.

Biomedicine and pharmacotherapy,2021,Hippocampus kuda protein hydrolysate improves male reproductive dysfunction in diabetic rats,"The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing. This disease is associated with many complications including male reproductive dysfunctions and infertility. Seahorse ( Hippocampus kuda) is a marine teleost fish well known for its beneficial effects on the reproductive system in traditional Chinese medicine books. Recently, several studies have been shown that the enzymatic hydrolysate of seahorse has multiple pharmacological activities. This study aimed to investigate the seahorse peptide hydrolysate (SH) ameliorative effects on the diabetic-induced male reproductive dysfunction in rat models. The in vivo studies were carried out with three different doses of SH (4, 8, and 20 mg/kg) and the diabetes condition was induced by administrating with streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) and fed a 40% high-fat diet. Seahorse hydrolysate (20 mg/kg) inhibited lipid peroxidation, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and restored seminiferous tubules morphology in testis. Moreover, it improved reproductive dysfunction by increasing the level of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, sperm count, and motility. According to these results, we suggested that SH exhibited amelioration effects on the reproductive dysfunction. © 2021 The Authors",10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111760,article,SCOPUS,"Sudirman, Sabri","Su, Chieh-Yu","Tsou, David","Lee, Meng-Chou","Kong, Zwe-Ling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2016,Recent Research in Antihypertensive Activity of Food Protein-derived Hydrolyzates and Peptides,"Year to year obesity prevalence, reduced physical activities, bad habits/or stressful lifestyle, and other environmental and physiological impacts lead to increase in diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension worldwide. Hypertension is considered as one of the most common serious chronic diseases; however, discovery of medications with high efficacy and without side effects for treatment of patients remains a challenge for scientists. Recent trends in functional foods have evidenced that food bioactive proteins play a major role in the concepts of illness and curing; therefore, nutritionists, biomedical scientists, and food scientists are working together to develop improved systems for the discovery of peptides with increased potency and therapeutic benefits. This review presents a recent research carried out to date for the purpose of isolation and identification of bioactive hydrolyzates and peptides with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity and antihypertensive effect from animal, marine, microbial, and plant food proteins. Effects of food processing and hydrolyzation conditions as well as some other impacts on formation, activity, and stability of these hydrolyzates and peptides are also presented. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/10408398.2012.724478,article,SCOPUS,"Saleh, Ahmed S.

Biotechnology of bioactive compounds: sources and applications,2015,Seaweed and milk derived bioactive peptides and small molecules in functional foods and cosmeceuticals,"Cosmeceuticals, like functional foods, contain functional ingredients with either therapeutic, healing, or health beneficial properties. Milk and marine substrates such as seaweeds are a rich source of both functional food and cosmeceutical ingredients. Indeed, both milk and seaweeds, in particular the red and green seaweeds, are a rich reservoir of protein that contain essential amino acids and peptides. Bioactive peptides, or cryptides, are amino acid sequences of between 2 and 30 amino acids in length that can impart a health benefit to the consumer when eaten or topically applied. They can be generated through hydrolysis and processing or, as is the case with endogenous antimicrobial peptides, can often be present naturally in organs such as skin. These peptides can exert beneficial effects through the inhibition of enzymes important in the control of saltwater balance and blood pressure (ACE-I, renin) as well as through the inhibition of other enzymes such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) that are important in the control of diseases associated with metabolic syndrome such as type 2 diabetes. This chapter discusses how peptides that were identified previously for use in functional foods may also have a role as cosmeceutical agents. The chapter also highlights the role of other marine-derived bioactives such as phlorotannins and carotenoids as functional food ingredients and the role they play in the inhibition of enzymes important in skin aging and discoloration, including inhibition of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and the importance of these peptides in cosmeceuticals. The bioavailability of peptides that are intended for ingestion is also discussed and examples of functional food and cosmeceutical products that are available on the market are provided. Reference is also made to the regulations governing the sale and supply of functional food products and cosmeceuticals. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Marine proteins and peptides: biological activities and applications,2013,Health Effects of Antioxidative and Antihypertensive Peptides from Marine Resources,"The health benefits of a diet rich in seafood (fish and shellfish) are well recognised. In recent years, increased attention has been directed towards the potential health benefits of peptides of marine origin. Some peptides have been found to exhibit antioxidative and antihypertensive properties. This chapter reviews the properties of marine-derived peptides and evaluates their health benefits. Whereas antioxidative peptides may provide a beneficial effect in the gut, preventing unwanted food oxidation, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides need to be absorbed in the intestine in order to enter the bloodstream and exert a physiological effect at the target site. According to theoretical knowledge, the antioxidants can prevent oxidative stress linked to several diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, as well as ageing. Evaluation of the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors from marine sources covers in vitro studies, animal studies and human clinical trials. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/9781118375082.ch14,chapter,SCOPUS,"Jensen, Ida-Johanne","Eilertsen, Karl-Erik","Mæhre, Hanne K.","Elvevoll, Edel O.","Larsen, Rune",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2009,"Addition of n-3 fatty acids to a 4-hour lipid infusion does not affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or markers of oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus","Fatty acids (FA) can impair glucose metabolism to a varying degree depending on time of exposure and also of type of FA. Here we tested for acute effects of marine n-3 FA on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A 4-hour lipid infusion (Intralipid [Fresenius Kabi, Halden, Norway], total of 384 mL) was compared with a similar lipid infusion partly replaced by Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi) that contributed a median of 0.1 g fish oil per kilogram body weight, amounting to 0.04 g/kg of marine n-3 FA. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps; insulin secretion (measured after the clamps), by C-peptide glucagon tests; and energy metabolism, by indirect calorimetry. Infusion of Omegaven increased the proportion of n-3 FA in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) compared with Intralipid alone (20:5n-3: median, 1.5% [interquartile range, 0.6%] vs -0.2% [0.2%], P = .001; 22:6n-3: 0.8% [0.4%] vs -0.7% [0.2%], P = .001). However, glucose utilization was not affected; neither was insulin secretion or total energy production (P = .966, .210, and .423, respectively, for the differences between the lipid clamps). Omegaven tended to lower oxidation of fat (P = .062) compared with Intralipid only, correlating with the rise in individual n-3 NEFA (r = 0.627, P = .039). The effects of clamping on phospholipid FA composition, leptin, adiponectin, or F2-isoprostane concentrations were not affected by Omegaven. Enrichment of NEFA with n-3 FA during a 4-hour infusion of Intralipid failed to affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or markers of oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.metabol.2009.06.003,article,SCOPUS,"Mostad, Ingrid L.","Bjerve, Kristian S.","Basu, Samar","Sutton, Pauline","Frayn, Keith N.","Grill, Valdemar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metabolism,1989,Dose-response effects of dietary marine oil on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in normal subjects and patients with hypertriglyceridemia,"Recent studies indicate that marine (ω-3) fatty acids decrease hypertriglyceridemia but worsen hyperglycemia in diabetes. We studied dose-response relationships between ω-3 intake and indices of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 21 hypertriglyceridemic patients with (n = 6) or without (n = 15) diabetes, and 6 normal volunteers. All subjects consumed isocaloric diets of 65% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 15% protein. The basal diet contained 15% of total calories as vegetable oil (ω-6), and the test diets included 15%, 7.5%, or 3.75% calories as fish oil (MaxEPA). After three months of the basal diet, patients were randomized to receive two 3-month ω-3 diets in the following sequences: 15% 7.5%, 7.5% 15%, 7.5% 3.75%, or 3.75% 7.5%. Both 15% and 7.5% diets, regardless of sequence, significantly decreased serum triglycerides but increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels as much as 98% and the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio as much as 1.6-fold. Daily insulin requirements of three diabetic patients increased progressively while they received an ω-3-enriched diet for up to 2 years. In healthy controls, favorable changes induced by an ω-3 fatty acid diet in serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated with a tendency toward an inhibition of C-peptide secretion following a meal challenge. We conclude that substitution of commercially available ω-3 for ω-6 fatty acids improves hypertriglyceridemia but may worsen other lipoprotein indices and may increase insulin requirements in diabetic hypertriglyceridemic subjects. © 1989.",10.1016/0026-0495(89)90004-8,article,SCOPUS,"Stacpoole, Peter W.","Alig, Janice","Ammon, Linda","Crockett, Samuel E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enzyme and microbial technology,2007,Screening of inhibitors of porcine dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in aqueous extracts from marine organisms,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) hydrolyses biologically active peptides that control critical functions. For example, action of glucagons-like peptide I, an hormone that plays multiple roles in metabolic homeostasis and a potential agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is diminished by its susceptibility to DPPIV activity. The goal of this work was to the search for DPPIV inhibitory activity in the Caribbean marine fauna. The screening was done in aqueous crude extracts of species belonging to phyla Cnidaria, Mollusca, Annelida, Echinodermata, Poriphera, Chordata, Chlorophycota and Chlorophyta collected on the Northern coast of Havana (Cuba). An inhibitory activity was found in extracts of three species belonging to phyla Poriphera and Cnidaria: the sponge Xetospongia muta and the sea anemones Bunodosoma granulifera and Bartholomea annulata. The crude extracts from these species were treated with 2.5% final concentration of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or with heat (60 °C, 10 min). Both treatments increased inhibitory activity in X. muta but failed in B. granulifera and B. annulata extracts. Preliminary characterization indicated that in each case the effect on DPPIV activity is dose-dependent, the inhibition is slow and the molecule responsible for DPPIV inhibition has a low molecular weight. The present contribution shows that the detected species are promising sources of DPPIV natural inhibitors with potential therapeutic applications. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Diabetologia,2015,Polyphenol-rich diets improve glucose metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk: a controlled randomised intervention trial,"Aim/hypothesis: Dietary polyphenols and long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. This may relate to their influence on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. We evaluated the effects of diets naturally rich in polyphenols and/or LCn3 of marine origin on glucose metabolism in people at high cardiometabolic risk. Methods: According to a 2 × 2 factorial design, individuals with high waist circumference and at least one more component of the metabolic syndrome were recruited at the obesity outpatient clinic. Eighty-six participants were randomly assigned by MINIM software to an isoenergetic diet: (1) control, low in LCn3 and polyphenol (analysed n = 20); (2) rich in LCn3 (n = 19); (3) rich in polyphenols (n = 19); or (4) rich in LCn3 and polyphenols (n = 19). The assigned diets were known for the participants and blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after the 8 week intervention, participants underwent a 3 h OGTT and a test meal with a similar composition as the assigned diet for the evaluation of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations, and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. Results: During OGTT, polyphenols significantly reduced plasma glucose total AUC (p = 0.038) and increased early insulin secretion (p = 0.048), while LCn3 significantly reduced beta cell function (p = 0.031) (two-factor ANOVA). Moreover, polyphenols improved post-challenge oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS; p = 0.05 vs control diet by post hoc ANOVA). At test meal, LCn3 significantly reduced GLP-1 total postprandial AUC (p < 0.001; two-factor ANOVA). Conclusion/interpretation: Diets naturally rich in polyphenols reduce blood glucose response, likely by increasing early insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. These effects may favourably influence diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The implications of the decrease in insulin secretion and postprandial GLP-1 observed with diets rich in marine LCn3 need further clarification.

Biomedical and environmental sciences,2010,Effect of marine collagen peptides on markers of metabolic nuclear receptors in type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension,"Objective To explore Effects of marine collagen peptides (MCPs) on markers of metablic nuclear receptors, i.e peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARs), liver X receptor (LXRs) and farnesoid X receptor (FXRs) in type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension. Method Study population consisted of 200 type 2 diabetic patients with/without hypertension and 50 healthy subjects, all of whom were randomly assigned to MCPs-treated diabetics (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics (n=50), MCPs-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), placebo-treated diabetics with hypertension (n=50), and healthy controls (n=50). MCPs or placebo (water-soluble starch) were given daily before breakfast and bedtime over three months. Levels of free fatty acid, cytochrome P450, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, bradykinin, NO, and Prostacyclin were determined before intervention, and 1.5 months, and 3 months after intervention. Hypoglycemia and the endpoint events during the study were recorded and compared among the study groups. Result At the end of the study period, MCPs-treated patients showed marked improvement compared with patients receiving placebo. The protection exerted by MCPs seemed more profound in diabetics than in diabetics with hypertension. In particular, after MCPs intervention, levels of free fatty acid, hs-CRP, resistin, Prostacyclin decreased significantly in diabetics and tended to decrease in diabetic and hypertensive patients whereas levels of cytochrome P450, leptin, NO tended to decrease in diabetics with/without hypertension. Meanwhile, levels of adiponectin and bradykinin rose markedly in diabetics following MCPs administration. Conclusion MCPs could offer protection against diabetes and hypertension by affecting levels of molecules involved in diabetic and hypertensive pathogenesis. Regulation on metabolic nuclear receptors by MCPs may be the possible underlying mechanism for its observed effects in the study. Further study into its action may shed light on development of new drugs based on bioactive peptides from marine sources.

Food and function,2015,"Efficacy and safety of a dieckol-rich extract (AG-dieckol) of brown algae, Ecklonia cava, in pre-diabetic individuals: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial","The effects of 12 weeks of supplementation with a dieckol-rich extract (AG-dieckol) from brown algae, Ecklonia cava, on glycemic parameters, serum biochemistry, and hematology were investigated in this study. Eighty pre-diabetic male and female adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups designated as placebo and AG-dieckol (1500 mg per day). Compared with the placebo group, the AG-dieckol group showed a significant decrease in postprandial glucose levels after 12 weeks. The AG-dieckol group also showed a significant decrease in insulin and C-peptide levels after 12 weeks, but there was no significant difference between the AG-dieckol and placebo groups. There were no significant adverse events related to the consumption of AG-dieckol, and biochemical and hematological parameters were maintained within the normal range during the intervention period. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that AG-dieckol supplementation significantly contributes to lowering postprandial hyperglycemia and in reducing insulin resistance. Furthermore, we believe that based on these results the consumption of phlorotannin-rich foods such as marine algae may be useful for the treatment of diabetes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",10.1039/c4fo00940a,article,SCOPUS,"Lee, Seung-Hong","Jeon, You-Jin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
European journal of medicinal chemistry,2013,Evidence for a new binding mode to GSK-3: Allosteric regulation by the marine compound palinurin,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is widely recognised as a relevant player in the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3β inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3β inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GSK-3β. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3β inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.",10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.12.014,article,SCOPUS,"Bidon-Chanal, Axel","Fuertes, Ana","Alonso, Diana","Pérez, Daniel I.","Martínez, Ana","Luque, F.

Frontiers in endocrinology,2013,Ratiometric measurements of adiponectin by mass spectrometry in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) with iron overload reveal an association with insulin resistance and glucagon,"High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels are reduced in humans with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Similar to humans with insulin resistance, managed bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) diagnosed with hemochromatosis (iron overload) have higher levels of 2 h post-prandial plasma insulin than healthy controls. A parallel reaction monitoring assay for dolphin serum adiponectin was developed based on tryptic peptides identified by mass spectrometry. Using identified post-translational modifications, a differential measurement was constructed. Total and unmodified adiponectin levels were measured in sera from dolphins with (n = 4) and without (n = 5) iron overload. This measurement yielded total adiponectin levels as well as site specific percent unmodified adiponectin that may inversely correlate with HMW adiponectin. Differences in insulin levels between iron overload cases and controls were observed 2 h post-prandial, but not during the fasting state. Thus, post-prandial as well as fasting serum adiponectin levels were measured to determine whether adiponectin and insulin would follow similar patterns. There was no difference in total adiponectin or percent unmodified adiponectin from case or control fasting animals. There was no difference in post-prandial total adiponectin levels between case and control dolphins (mean ± SD) at 763 ± 298 and 727 ± 291 pmol/ml, respectively (p = 0.91); however, percent unmodified adiponectin was significantly higher in post-prandial cases compared to controls (30.0 ± 6.3 versus 17.0 ± 6.6%, respectively; p = 0.016). Interestingly, both total and percent unmodified adiponectin were correlated with glucagon levels in controls (r = 0.999, p < 0.001), but not in cases, which is possibly a reflection of insulin resistance. Although total adiponectin levels were not significantly different, the elevated percent unmodified adiponectin follows a trend similar to HMW adiponectin reported for humans with metabolic disorders. © 2013 Neely, Carlin, Arthur, McFee and Janech.",10.3389/fendo.2013.00132,article,SCOPUS,"Neely, Benjamin A.","Carlin, Kevin P.","Arthur, John M.","McFee, Wayne E.","Janech, Michael G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutrition and diabetes,2014,Fatty fish consumption and risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults,"OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that intake of fatty fish may protect against both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hypotheses rest on the high marine omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) and vitamin D contents, with possible beneficial effects on immune function and glucose metabolism. Our aim was to investigate, for the first time, fatty fish consumption in relation to the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: Analyses were based on data from a Swedish case-control study with incident cases of LADA (n = 89) and type 2 diabetes (n = 462) and randomly selected diabetes-free controls (n = 1007). Diabetes classification was based on the onset of age (>35), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and C-peptide. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to derive information on previous intake of fish, polyunsaturated long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and supplementation of fish oil and vitamin D. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, education, and consumption of alcohol, fruit, vegetables and red meat. RESULTS: Weekly fatty fish consumption (>1 vs o1 serving per week), was associated with a reduced risk of LADA but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87, and 1.01, 95% CI 0.74-1.39, respectively). Similar associations were seen for estimated intake of n-3 PUFA (>0.3 g per day; LADA: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.03, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.58) and fish oil supplementation (LADA: OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.19-1.12, type 2 diabetes: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fatty fish consumption may reduce the risk of LADA, possibly through effects of marineoriginated omega-3 fatty acids. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",10.1038/nutd.2014.36,article,SCOPUS,"Löfvenborg, J.E.","Andersson, T.","Carlsson, P.O.","Dorkhan, M.","Groop, L.","Martinell, M.","Tuomi, T.","Wolk, A.","Carlsson, S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine proteins and peptides: biological activities and applications,2013,"Bioactive Proteins and Peptides from Macroalgae, Fish, Shellfish and Marine Processing Waste","Macroalgal, fish and shellfish proteins represent a vast resource for the mining of novel biofunctional peptides with specific or multifunctional activity. Enzymatic hydrolysis of macroalgal, fish and shellfish processing waste proteins with proteolytic preparations from plant, animal or microbial sources has the capability to release an array of peptides with potential biofunctional properties in a highly controlled environment. A growing body of scientific evidence demonstrates that many marine-derived protein hydrolysates and peptides, including macroalgal, fish and shellfish processing waste byproducts, may play a role in the prevention and management of certain chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancer and obesity-related chronic conditions, and thus can be used as functional food ingredients. Finally, marketing of bioactive health-promoting functional ingredients requires scientific validation before a health claim can be made with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU) approval. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/9781118375082.ch2,chapter,SCOPUS,"Harnedy, Pádraigín A.","Fitzgerald, Richard J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
American journal of the medical sciences,2010,Therapeutic effects of marine collagen peptides on Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and primary hypertension,"Marine collagen peptides (MCPs) from deep sea fish are shown to ameliorate hyperlipidemia in animal models. The study aimed at examining the effects of MCPs on glucose and lipid metabolism in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and primary hypertension. Methods: One hundred patients with T2DM and primary hypertension and 50 healthy subjects (normal controls) were recruited for a randomized double blind study. The patients were randomized into MCPs treatment or patient control groups (n = 50 per group). Both patient controls and normal controls were given carboxymethylcellulose twice daily whereas the MCPs treatment group was given MCPs twice daily for 3 months. Blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, cytochrome P450, nitric oxide, bradykinin, prostacyclin, creatinine, uric acid and adipokines were measured at baseline, 1.5 and 3 months after treatment. All patients received regular medicines for control of hyperglycemia and hypertension. Results: Compared with patient controls, significantly reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and creatinine but increased levels of Insulin Sensitivity Index and Insulin Secretion Index were observed in patients receiving MCPs treatment. Furthermore, significantly reduced levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, free fatty acids, cytochrome P450, nitric oxide and prostacyclin but increased levels of high-density lipoprotein, bradykinin and adiponectin were detected in patients taking MCPs. Conclusions: MCPs supplement may benefit glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, renal function and hypertension management in Chinese patients with T2DM and hypertension. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181edfcf2,article,SCOPUS,"Zhu, Cui-Feng","Li, Guan-Zhi","Peng, Hong-Bin","Zhang, Fan","Chen, Yun","Li, Yong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2012,Marine bioactives: Pharmacological properties and potential applications against inflammatory diseases,"Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",10.3390/md10040812,review,SCOPUS,"D'Orazio, Nicolantonio","Gammone, Maria Alessandra","Gemello, Eugenio","De Girolamo, Massimo","Cusenza, Salvatore","Riccioni, Graziano",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Life sciences,2012,Modulation of TRPV1-dependent contractility of normal and diabetic bladder smooth muscle by analgesic toxins from sea anemone Heteractis crispa,"Aims: TRPV1-expressing, capsaicin (CAP)-sensitive afferent fibers innervating bladder in addition to sensory function also exhibit efferent features consisting in TRPV1-dependent release of tachykinins (TAC) affecting detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) contractions. Our aim was to investigate the effects of two novel polypeptide inhibitors of TRPV1 from the venom of tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa, APHC1 and APHC3, on the contractions of DSM from bladders of normal and diabetic rats. Main methods: Experiments were conducted on urothelium-devoid DSM strips from normal rats and rats 8 weeks after streptozotocin-induced diabetes by means of contraction force measurements. Key findings: Pre-exposure of DSM strips to APHC1 or APHC3 (200 nM) specifically inhibited CAP-induced, TRPV1-dependent contractions. Both peptides also transiently enhanced basal tone and spontaneous contractions of DSM strips followed by delayed suppression of electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) contractions. The decrease of the amplitude of EFS-evoked NANC contractions by APHC1 or APHC3 reached 38.5 ± 3.4% and 25.1 ± 1.6%, respectively, in normal DSM strips and 46.3 ± 3.3% and 43.9 ± 1.8%, respectively, in diabetic ones. APHC-peptide-induced transient enhancement of basal tone could be mimicked by serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride (300 μM). Significance: Our results demonstrate that APHC1 and APHC3 may be considered as effective inhibitors of bladder contractility especially during diabetic cystopathy. Modality of action of APHC-polypeptides via the mechanisms involving decreased TRPV1-dependent release of TAC from bladder afferents and suppression of TAC degradation due to their activity as endogenous proteases inhibitors is proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Marine drugs,2015,A new member of the TBC1D15 family from Chiloscyllium plagiosum: Rab GTPase-activating protein based on Rab7 as a substrate,"APSL (active peptide from shark liver) is a hepatic stimulator cytokine from the liver of Chiloscyllium. It can effectively protect islet cells and improve complications in mice with alloxan-induced diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that the APSL sequence is present in the N-terminus of novel TBC (Tre-2, Bub2 and Cdc16) domain family, member 15 (TBC1D15) from Chiloscyllium plagiosum. This shark TBC1D15 gene, which contains an ORF of 2088 bp, was identified from a cDNA library of regenerating shark liver. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the gene is highly homologous to TBC1D15 genes from other species. Moreover, the N-terminus of shark TBC1D15 contains a motif of unknown function (DUF3548), which encompasses the APSL fragment. Rab-GAP activity analysis showed that shark TBC1D15 is a new member of the TBC1D15 family. These results demonstrated that shark TBC1D15 possesses Rab-GAP activity using Rab7 as a substrate, which is a common property of the TBC1D15 family. The involvement of APSL at the N-terminus of TBC1D15 also demonstrates that this protein might be involved in insulin signaling and may be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. The current findings pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of these proteins from marine sources. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",10.3390/md13052955,article,SCOPUS,"Li, Yuanyuan","Wang, Weidong","Cheng, Dandan","Wang, Tao","Lu, Conger","Chen, Jian","Nie, Zuoming","Zhang, Wenping","Lv, Zhengbing","Wu, Wutong","Shu, Jianhong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acs central science,2016,Potent human alpha;-amylase inhibition by the β-defensin-like protein helianthamide,"Selective inhibitors of human pancreatic α-amylase (HPA) are an effective means of controlling blood sugar levels in the management of diabetes. A high-throughput screen of marine natural product extracts led to the identification of a potent (Ki = 10 pM) peptidic HPA inhibitor, helianthamide, from the Caribbean sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus. Active helianthamide was produced in Escherichia coli via secretion as a barnase fusion protein. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex of helianthamide with porcine pancreatic α-amylase revealed that helianthamide adopts a β;-defensin fold and binds into and across the amylase active site, utilizing a contiguous YIYH inhibitory motif. Helianthamide represents the first of a novel class of glycosidase inhibitors and provides an unusual example of functional malleability of the β-defensin fold, which is rarely seen outside of its traditional role in antimicrobial peptides. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acscentsci.5b00399,article,SCOPUS,"Tysoe, Christina","Williams, Leslie K.","Keyzers, Robert","Nguyen, Nham T.","Tarling, Chris","Wicki, Jacqueline","Goddard-Borger, Ethan D.","Aguda, Adeleke H.","Perry, Suzanne","Foster, Leonard J.","Andersen, Raymond J.","Brayer, Gary D.","Withers, Stephen G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore we have investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide new drugs for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We have been searching for new types of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi. This review presents their structural diversities and unique biological properties.

International journal of peptide research and therapeutics,2021,In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of Palmaria palmata Derived Peptides on Glucose Metabolism,"Three synthetic peptides, ILAP, LLAP and MAGVDHI, derived from a Palmaria palmata protein hydrolysate were assessed for their antidiabetic potential in vitro and in vivo. In addition to inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-IV in a cell-based in situ assay all three peptides significantly increased the half-life of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). ILAP and LLAP mediated a significant increase (p < 0.001) in insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 cells compared to the glucose control, while MAGVDHI had no insulinotropic activity at an eqimolar concentration (10(-6) M). A significant increase in the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in BRIN-BD11 cells mediated by ILAP (p < 0.001) and LLAP (p < 0.01) compared to the basal control, would indicate that insulin secretion may be mediated by membrane based activation. Furthermore, ILAP and LLAP acted as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secretagogues, stimulating a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the concentration of GIP released from enteroendocrine STC-1 cells compared to the glucose control. When tested in vivo in healthy male NIH Swiss mice, ILAP and LLAP, mediated a significant increase (p < 0.01) in plasma insulin and decrease (p < 0.05) in blood glucose, respectively, compared to the control. MAGVDHI mediated a significant (p < 0.001) sustained reduction in food intake in food deprived trained mice.

The IRLIIVLMPILMA tridecapeptide that exhibits an in vivo level of activity similar to the hypotensive clinical drug captopril should still be stressed, as well as griffithsin which showed such stunning results over a variety of animal models and which will probably move onto clinical trials soon. Regarding clinical trials, studies with pure algal metabolites are scarce, limited to those carried out with kahalalide F and fucoxanthin. The majority of clinical trials currently aim to ascertain the effect of algae consumption, as extracts or fractions, on obesity and diabetes.",10.3390/md18010008,review,WoS,"Rosa, Goncalo P."," Tavares, Wilson R."," Sousa, Pedro M.

Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2020,Recently isolated antidiabetic hydrolysates and peptides from multiple food sources: a review,"Diabetes, a metabolic syndrome of global importance has been on a progressive rise in recent years. Several pharmacological approaches have been made, which have proved effective, but with underlying side effects. Bioactive hydrolysates (BHs) and peptides (BPs) from food sources, however, have shown the relative advantage of imparting less adverse effects. Furthermore, BHs and BPs from food have been discovered to impart their antidiabetic potentials through one or more mechanisms such as inhibition of digestive enzymes, inhibition of the antigenic enzyme Dipeptyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), decrease in blood glucose levels and increase in insulin uptake. Several plants and animal sources have been used as protein sources for the isolation of antidiabetic hydrolysates and peptides through different mechanisms and analytical techniques. This review integrates recent research information about several popular and unconventional food sources of BHs and BPs, their isolation techniques, antidiabetic effects and protein profiles. In addition, the fractionation technique(s) employed in each study and inhibition potentials of BHs and BPs are reviewed. This article is intended to supplement accessible scholarly literature and intellectual awareness on the subject of food-oriented approach for the management of diabetes.",10.1080/10408398.2018.1528206,review,WoS,"Kehinde, Bababode Adesegun"," Sharma, Poorva",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foods,2023,Fucoidan from Laminaria japonica Ameliorates Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Association with Modulation of Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in Streptozocin-Treated Mice,"Chronic diseases have been a leading cause of death worldwide, and polysaccharide supplementation is an effective therapeutic strategy for chronic diseases without adverse effects. In this study, the beneficial effect of Laminaria japonica fucoidan (LJF) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated in streptozocin-treated mice. LJF ameliorated the symptoms of T2DM in a dose-dependent manner, involving reduction in weight loss, water intake, triglyceride, blood glucose, cholesterol and free fatty acids, and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, catalase, glucagon-like peptide-1, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, LJF regulated the balance between insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity, reduced islet necrosis and beta-cell damage, and inhibited fat accumulation in T2DM mice. The protective effect of LJF on T2DM can be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolites, e.g., increases in Lactobacillus and Allobaculum. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics analysis showed that the microbiota metabolite profile was changed with LJF-induced microbiota alterations, mainly involving amino acids, glutathione, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. This study indicates that LJF can be used as a prebiotic agent for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and microbiota-related diseases.",10.3390/foods12010033,article,WoS,"Zhang, Chenxi"," Jia, Jinhui"," Zhang, Panpan"," Zheng, Weiyun"," Guo, Xiaoming"," Ai, Chunqing"," Song, Shuang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ophthalmic research,2023,Quantitatively Evaluating the Relationships between Insulin Resistance and Retinal Neurodegeneration with Optical Coherence Tomography in Early Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess retinal neurodegenerative changes with optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without diabetic retinopathy (DR) and evaluate their relationships with insulin resistance (IR) and associated systemic indicators. Methods: 102 T2DM patients without DR and 48 healthy controls were included in this observational cross-sectional study. The OCT parameters of macular retinal thickness (MRT) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses were evaluated between diabetic and normal eyes. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was generated to evaluate the discrimination power of early diabetes. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed between ophthalmological parameters and T2DM-related demographic and anthropometric variables, and serum biomarkers and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores. Results: MRT and GCIPL thicknesses showed significant thinning in patients, especially in inferotemporal area. High body mass index (BMI) correlated with decreased GCIPL thicknesses and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). A negative correlation between waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and GCIPL thicknesses was also found. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) and fasting C-peptide (CP0) were associated with GCIPL thickness but only in inferotemporal region (r = 0.20, p = 0.04; r = -0.20, p = 0.05, respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that increased HOMA-IR scores independently predicted both average (beta = -0.30, p = 0.05) and inferotemporal (beta = -0.34, p = 0.03) GCIPL thinning. Conclusion: Retinal thinning in early T2DM was associated with obesity-related metabolic disorders. IR as an independent risk factor for retinal neurodegeneration may increase the risk of developing glaucoma.",10.1159/000530904,article,WoS,"Zheng, Zhaoxia"," Yan, Meng"," Zhang, Duo"," Li, Lu"," Zhang, Lina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2013,Seaweeds as potential therapeutic interventions for the metabolic syndrome,"Seaweeds are a characteristic part of the traditional diet in countries such as Japan and Korea; these countries also have a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome than countries such as the USA and Australia. This suggests that seaweeds may contain compounds that reduce the characteristic signs of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver and inflammation in the metabolic syndrome. Potentially bioactive compounds from seaweeds include polysaccharides, peptides, pigments, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids. This review emphasises current research on these compounds in isolated cells, animal models and patients. Key problems for future research include chemical characterisation of the bioactive principles, defining pharmacological responses in all aspects of the metabolic syndrome, determining if a therapeutic dose has been administered, and defining oral bioavailability of the active ingredients.",10.1007/s11154-013-9254-8,review,WoS,"Kumar, Senthil Arun"," Brown, Lindsay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turkish journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences,2018,Evaluation of the in vitro α-Amylase Enzyme Inhibition Potential of Commercial Dried Laver (Porphyra Species) Seaweed Protein Hydrolysate,"Modulating alpha-amylase enzyme activity with bioactive peptides of protein hydrolysate is one of a viable strategy in the management of diabetes through the control of postprandial glucose level. In this study, four proteolytic enzymes (pepsin, neutrase, alcalase and trypsin) were used to investigate the in vitro alpha-amylase inhibition of dried laver seaweed (Porphyra species) protein hydrolysates. Pepsin hydrolysate showed effective inhibition rate at an IC50 value of 1.86 mg/mL protein as compared to other enzyme hydrolysate. This hydrolysate was fractionated in to three groups in molecular weight (MW) cutoff of 5 and 10 kDa (MW<5kDa, MW = 5-10kDa and MW>10kDa). The MW<5kDa showed better inhibition rate with IC50 value of 1.18mg/mL. This fraction (MW<5kDa) was further separated to three fractions (F-I, F-II & F-III) using gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25. F-III achieved higher alpha-amylase inhibition at an IC50 value of 0.87mg/mL. The MW distribution of F-III showed the smallest MW fractions of 90-1000Da. It can be concluded that pepsin hydrolysate of seaweed protein demonstrated a high potential in inhibiting a alpha-amylase activity, and thus, could be used as an ingredient for development of functional foods having anti-hyperglycaemic effect.",10.4194/1303-2712-v18_4_06,article,WoS,"Admassu, Habtamu"," Gasmalla, Mohammed Abdalbasit A."," Yang, Ruijin"," Zhao, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,Green Alga Enteromorpha prolifera Oligosaccharide Ameliorates Ageing and Hyperglycemia through Gut-Brain Axis in Age-Matched Diabetic Mice,"Scope To investigate the anti-ageing and anti-diabetic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera oligosaccharide (EPO) in age-matched streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. Methods and Results LC-MS metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing is used to identify the brain metabolites and gut microbiota, respectively. EPO could significantly improve glucose metabolism and activity of total superoxide dismutase in serum. It also could regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, arginine, and inosine-related metabolic pathways in the brain of aged diabetic mice. Inosine is found to enhance the relative expressions of daf-2, daf-16, and skn-1 in insulin-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, EPO could alter the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in mice. It could upregulate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3/Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1)/B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) pathways in the brain and the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)/FOXO1/Bcl-6 signaling axis in the intestine to regulate glucose metabolite status and ageing in mice. EPO could also improve the levels of glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP1) expression in the gut, thereby inducing high expression of GLP1 receptor in the brain to control glucose metabolites through the brain-gut axis. Enterococcus is negatively correlated with AMP in the brain and could be a potential hallmark species in age-related diabetes. Conclusions These results suggest that EPO could be a potential novel natural drug for the treatment of diabetes in the elderly.",10.1002/mnfr.202100564,article,WoS,"Ouyang, Yuezhen"," Liu, Dan"," Zhang, Lizhu"," Li, Xiaoqing"," Chen, Xinhua"," Zhao, Chao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transplantation,2009,Human β-cell Precursors Mature Into Functional Insulin-producing Cells in an Immunoisolation Device: Implications for Diabetes Cell Therapies,"Background. Islet transplantation is limited by the need for chronic immunosuppression and the paucity of donor tissue. As new sources of human beta-cells are developed (e.g., stem cell-derived tissue), transplanting them in a durable device could obviate the need for immunosuppression, while also protecting the patient from any risk of tumorigenicity. Here, we studied (1) the survival and function of encapsulated human beta-cells and their progenitors and (2) the. engraftment of encapsulated murine beta-cells in allo- and autoimmune settings.Methods. Human islets and human fetal pancreatic islet-like cell clusters were encapsulated in polytetrafluorethylene devices (TheraCyte) and transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Graft survival and function was measured by immunohistochemistry, circulating human C-peptide levels, and blood glucose levels. Bioluminescent imaging was used to monitor encapsulated neonatal murine islets.Results. Encapsulated human islet-like cell clusters survived, replicated, and acquired a level of glucose responsive insulin secretion sufficient to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Bioluminescent imaging of encapsulated marine neonatal islets revealed a dynamic process of cell death followed by regrowth, resulting in robust long-term allograft survival. Further, in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes, encapsulated primary beta-cells ameliorated diabetes without stimulating a detectable T-cell response.Conclusions. We demonstrate for the first time that human beta-cells function is compatible with encapsulation in a durable, immunoprotective device. Moreover, our study suggests that encapsulation of beta-cells before terminal differentiation will be a successful approach for new cell-based therapies for diabetes, such as those derived from stem cells.",10.1097/TP.0b013e31819c86ea,article,WoS,"Lee, Seung-Hee"," Hao, Ergeng"," Savinov, Alexei Y."," Geron, Ifat"," Strongin, Alex Y."," Itkin-Ansari, Pamela",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrients,2020,"Oligo-Fucoidan Improves Diabetes-Induced Renal Fibrosis via Activation of Sirt-1, GLP-1R, and Nrf2/HO-1: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study","Fucoidan extracted from brown algae has multiple beneficial functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of low-molecular-weight fucoidan (oligo-FO) on renal fibrosis under in vitro and in vivo diabetic conditions, and its molecular mechanisms. Advanced glycation product (AGE)-stimulated rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) and diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and nicotinamide were used. Oligo-FO treatment significantly inhibited anti-high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/RAGE/ anti-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)/transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)/TGF-beta 1R/Smad 2/3/fibronectin signaling pathway and HIF-1 alpha activation in AGE-stimulated NRK-52E cells. Conversely, the expression and activity of Sirt-1; the levels of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), p-AMPK, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1); and Nrf2 activation were remarkably increased by oligo-FO in AGE-stimulated cells. However, the above effects of oligo-FO were greatly diminished by inhibiting Sirt-1, HO-1, or GLP-1R activity. Similar changes of these pro-fibrotic genes in the kidney and a marked attenuation of renal injury and dysfunction were observed in oligo-FO-treated diabetic mice. These findings indicated that the inhibitory effects of the oligo-FO on diabetes-evoked renal fibrosis are mediated by suppressing TGF-beta 1-activated pro-fibrogenic processes via Sirt-1, HO-1, and GLP-1R dependence. Collectively, fucoidan-containing foods or supplements may be potential agents for ameliorating renal diseases due to excessive fibrosis.",10.3390/nu12103068,article,WoS,"Yu, Wen-Chun"," Huang, Ren-Yeong"," Chou, Tz-Chong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrients,2024,Food Proteins as Functional Ingredients in the Management of Chronic Diseases: A Concise Review,"Chronic diseases have emerged as a formidable global health concern, with their prevalence steadily rising over the years. Several approaches to addressing these concerns include the use of medications, which are often expensive, contain synthetic chemical substances, and have reported adverse effects. The use of foods, especially proteins, as an alternative approach to addressing chronic health concerns by treating and managing chronic diseases is increasing. This review evaluates the intriguing role of food proteins in mitigating chronic diseases and improving our understanding of the therapeutic potential of different protein types, including those derived from legumes, nuts, and seeds, dairy, fish, and numerous other sources. They have been reported to offer promising avenues for managing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic inflammation, weight management, bone health, glycemic control, muscle preservation, and many other health benefits. Although the exact mechanisms for these actions are still not properly elucidated, it is, however, understood that food proteins exert these health-beneficial effects by their unique nutritional and bioactive profiles, especially their bioactive peptides and amino acids. Practical applications are also discussed, including dietary interventions that are tailored towards incorporating protein-rich foods and the development of functional foods for disease prevention and management. Food proteins are a promising approach to combating chronic diseases that can turn around public health practices.",10.3390/nu16142323,review,WoS,"Shahnaz, Thaniyath"," Fawole, Abosede O."," Adeyanju, Adeyemi A."," Onuh, John O.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2021,Seaweed Components as Potential Modulators of the Gut Microbiota,"Macroalgae, or seaweeds, are a rich source of components which may exert beneficial effects on the mammalian gut microbiota through the enhancement of bacterial diversity and abundance. An imbalance of gut bacteria has been linked to the development of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, hypertension, type-2-diabetes, obesity, and cancer. This review outlines current knowledge from in vitro and in vivo studies concerning the potential therapeutic application of seaweed-derived polysaccharides, polyphenols and peptides to modulate the gut microbiota through diet. Polysaccharides such as fucoidan, laminarin, alginate, ulvan and porphyran are unique to seaweeds. Several studies have shown their potential to act as prebiotics and to positively modulate the gut microbiota. Prebiotics enhance bacterial populations and often their production of short chain fatty acids, which are the energy source for gastrointestinal epithelial cells, provide protection against pathogens, influence immunomodulation, and induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The oral bioaccessibility and bioavailability of seaweed components is also discussed, including the advantages and limitations of static and dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal models versus ex vivo and in vivo methods. Seaweed bioactives show potential for use in prevention and, in some instances, treatment of human disease. However, it is also necessary to confirm these potential, therapeutic effects in large-scale clinical trials. Where possible, we have cited information concerning these trials.",10.3390/md19070358,review,WoS,"Shannon, Emer"," Conlon, Michael"," Hayes, Maria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2024,Effect of Meroterpenoids from Sargassum macrocarpum on the Inhibition of Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation,"Amyloid polypeptide aggregation is considered one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the number of affected patients increases as the population ages. Amyloid beta (A beta) found in the brain of patients with AD and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) found in the pancreas of patients with T2D are thought to be cytotoxic during the aggregation process, especially the low-molecular-weight oligomers that are aggregation intermediates. In this study, meroterpenoids isolated and structurally determined from the brown alga Sargassum macrocarpum were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hIAPP aggregation. The results showed that 16 compounds from S. macrocarpum exhibited hIAPP aggregation-inhibitory activity, mainly through the inhibition of fiber elongation. These compounds showed higher activity with a hydroquinone moiety than with a quinone moiety, similar to their aggregation-inhibitory activity against A beta 42. Furthermore, these peptides demonstrated the potential to inhibit oligomer formation at high concentration ratios of 1 : 4 or higher. Further, compounds lacking hydroxyl groups did not exhibit this aggregation-inhibitory activity, suggesting that the phenolic hydroxyl group is essential for this activity.",10.1248/bpb.b24-00610,article,WoS,"Tozawa, Yuta"," Shinoda, Seiya"," Sekiguchi, Mitsuhiro"," Miyamae, Yusaku"," Shigemori, Hideyuki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foods,2025,"Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca, and Palmaria palmata as Potential Functional Food Ingredients for the Management of Metabolic Syndrome","Hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity raise an individual's risk of suffering from diseases associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). In humans, enzymes that play a role in the prevention and development of MS include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-1) associated with hypertension, alpha-amylase associated with T2D, and lipase linked to the development of obesity. Seaweeds are a rich source of bioactives consisting of proteins/peptides, polysaccharides, and lipids. This study examined the potential of seaweed-derived bioactives from Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca, and Palmaria palmata as inhibitors of ACE-1, alpha-amylase, and lipase. In vitro enzyme inhibitory assays were used to quantify the bioactivity of the seaweed extracts and compare their half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) values to recognised positive control enzyme inhibitory drugs captopril (c) (an ACE-1 inhibitor), acarbose (an alpha-amylase inhibitor), and orlistat (a lipase inhibitor). Three seaweed extracts displayed enzyme inhibitory activities equal to, or more effective than, the reference positive control drugs. These were P. palmata peptides (ACE-1 IC50 94.29 +/- 3.07 mu g/mL, vs. captopril (c) 91.83 +/- 2.68 mu g/mL); A. esculenta polyphenol extract (alpha-amylase IC50 147.04 +/- 9.72 mu g/mL vs. acarbose 185.67 +/- 12.48 mu g/mL, and lipase IC50 106.21 +/- 6.53 mu g/mL vs. orlistat 139.74 +/- 9.33 mu g/mL); and U. lactuca polysaccharide extract (alpha-amylase IC50 168.06 +/- 10.53 mu g/mL vs. acarbose 185.67 +/- 12.48 mu g/mL). Proximate analysis also revealed that all three seaweeds were a good source of protein, fibre, and polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (PUFAs).

Journal of functional foods,2010,Evidence of in vivo satietogen effect and control of food intake of smooth hound (Mustelus mustelus) muscle protein hydrolysate in rats,"Protein hydrolysates are of a significant interest, due to their potential application as a source of bioactive peptides in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical domains. The present study was focused on the effect of protein hydrolysate from smooth hound (Mustelus mustelus) (SHPH) in the regulation of components of the food intake control such as satiety. SHPH was produced by intestinal digestive proteases from the same species. The amino acid analysis by GC/MS showed that the hydrolysate was rich in leucine, alanine, glycine, threonine, serine, lysine and glutamate. The molecular weights of peptides in SHPH were estimated by ESI-MS to be between 200 and 2500 Da. Biological in vivo capacities of SHPH in rats were evaluated by determination of the CCK-like peptides and insulin content using a clinical human radioimmunoassay. The food intake and the body weight of rats were measured during the period of treatment. Rats treated with SHPH showed a significant decrease in body weight at the end of treatment, as well as a decrease of food intake. Our findings revealed a possible mechanism of the beneficial effects of SHPH in appetite regulation, and this might be important to prevent the risk of a number of medical conditions including type II diabetes.

Journal of applied phycology,2023,In vitro enzyme inhibitory effects of green and brown Australian seaweeds and potential impact on metabolic syndrome,"Hypertension, type-2-diabetes (T2D) and obesity are contributory risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome. Peptides, polyphenols and polysaccharides may inhibit enzymes involved in the disease pathways of this disorder. Peptide hydrolysates (PEP), polyphenol (PP) and polysaccharide (PS) extracts generated from the Australian seaweeds Phyllospora comosa (Labillardiere) C. Agardh, Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, and Ulva ohnoi M. Hiraoka & S. Shimada were screened in vitro for their potential to inhibit enzymes important in the control of diseases associated with metabolic syndrome. These enzymes include angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE-1; EC 3.4.15.1) which affects the development of hypertension in mammals, alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) and lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) which play a role in the development of T2D and dietary lipid absorption, respectively. The inhibitory activity of each seaweed extract was determined using established in vitro colorimetric methods with mammalian-derived enzymes and their respective substrates. The ACE-1 half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations of generated bioactive extracts ranged from 167.52 +/- 3.17 mu g mL(-1) (U. ohnoi PEP) to 713.84 +/- 12.45 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PS). None of the extracts screened displayed IC50 values comparable to the positive control drug Captopril (8.87 +/- 0.04 mu g mL(-1)). IC50 values determined for extracts that inhibited alpha-amylase ranged from 58.31 +/- 1.41 mu g mL(-1) (P. comosa PP) to 515.24 +/- 10.53 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PEP). All PS and PP had significantly lower IC50 values than the alpha-amylase inhibitor control, Acarbose (89.90 +/- 0.15 mu g mL(-1)). Lipase IC50 values determined for extracts ranged from 52.14 +/- 2.77 mu g mL(-1) (P. comosa PP) to 876.30 +/- 34.92 mu g mL(-1) (E. radiata PEP). All PP had significantly lower IC50 values than the lipase inhibitory drug Orlistat (70.83 +/- 0.07 mu g mL(-1)). To the authors' knowledge there are no published values for the inhibitory potential of P. comosa, E. radiata or U. ohnoi extracts against the enzymes ACE-1, alpha-amylase, or lipase.

Marine drugs,2019,Identifying Phlorofucofuroeckol-A as a Dual Inhibitor of Amyloid-β25-35 Self-Aggregation and Insulin Glycation: Elucidation of the Molecular Mechanism of Action,"Both amyloid-beta (A beta) and insulin are amyloidogenic peptides, and they play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Misfolded or aggregated A beta and glycated insulin are commonly found in AD and T2D patients, respectively, and exhibit neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. The present study examined the anti-A beta(25-35) aggregation and anti-insulin glycation activities of five phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia stolonifera. Thioflavin-T assay results suggest that eckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFFA) significantly inhibit A beta(25-35) self-assembly. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation analyses confirmed that these phlorotannins have a strong potential to interact with A beta(25-35) peptides and interrupt their self-assembly and conformational transformation, thereby inhibiting A beta(25-35) aggregation. In addition, PFFA dose-dependently inhibited d-ribose and d-glucose induced non-enzymatic insulin glycation. To understand the molecular mechanism for insulin glycation and its inhibition, we predicted the binding site of PFFA in insulin via computational analysis. Interestingly, PFFA strongly interacted with the Phe1 in insulin chain-B, and this interaction could block d-glucose access to the glycation site of insulin. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that phlorofucofuroeckol-A could be a new scaffold for AD treatment by inhibiting the formation of beta-sheet rich structures in A beta(25-35) and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in insulin.",10.3390/md17110600,article,WoS,"Seong, Su Hui"," Paudel, Pradeep"," Jung, Hyun Ah"," Choi, Jae Sue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recombinant protein (XP_001798711) was confirmed to be a novel fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPOX) with high specificity for a-glycated compounds, such as HbA1c model compounds fructosyl-N-alpha-valine (f-(alpha)Val) and fructosyl-N-alpha-valyl-histidine (f-(alpha)Val-His). Unlike previously reported FPOXs, the P. nodorum FPOX has a K-m value for f-(alpha)Val-His (0.185 mM) that is considerably lower than that for f-(alpha)Val (0.458 mM). Based on amino acid sequence alignment, three dimensional structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis, Gly60 was found to be a determining residue for the activity towards f-(alpha)Val-His. A flexible surface loop region was also found to likely play an important role in accepting f-(alpha)Val-His. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2010;106: 358-366.

Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2015,In vitro assessment of the multifunctional bioactive potential of Alaska pollock skin collagen following simulated gastrointestinal digestion,"BACKGROUNDDietary mineral deficiency, hypertension and diabetes have become serious human health problems. Dietary approaches are increasingly being investigated to address these issues. Identification of food-derived biological peptides has become an important approach to control such diseases. Peptides generated from aquatic byproducts have been shown to possess biological activities.RESULTSSignificantly higher copper-chelating activity was observed on simulated hydrolysis of intact collagen. The collagen hydrolysate generated in the gastric stage exhibited moderate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 2.920.22mgmL(-1), which significantly decreased to 0.49 +/- 0.02mgmL(-1) after intestinal digestion. The dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV-inhibitory potency of the collagen hydrolysate generated directly following simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) (IC50 2.59 +/- 0.04mgmL(-1)) was significantly lower than that of the collagen tryptic hydrolysate (CTH) (IC50 1.53 +/- 0.01mgmL(-1)). The antioxidant activities of collagen and CTH using the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay were 0.87 +/- 0.10 and 1.27 +/- 0.03 mu mol Trolox equivalent (TE) g(-1) respectively after SGID.CONCLUSION This study identifies collagen as a good and inexpensive substrate for the generation of biologically active peptides with potential applications as functional ingredients in the management of chronic illness and mineral deficiency problems.

3 biotech,2023,A comprehensive review on algal nutraceuticals as prospective therapeutic agent for different diseases,"Ongoing research in the food supplement sector provides insightful information regarding algae as a new-generation nutritional supplement and is also referred to as a superfood. Due to the diverse nutritional components, algae have documented numerous health benefits like fighting microbial diseases, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, algae-derived nutraceuticals account for a rapidly expanding market in the food supplements sector. The concept of algal prebiotics and their role in modulating gut microbiota have also been a chief contributor to this. This review evaluates the use of possible algal species and their specific bioactive compounds for the management of several chronic diseases. Proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, phenolics, and vitamins give an insight into the significance of algae in boosting the immune system and improving the body's nutritional makeup. In addition, phyco-compounds such as polysaccharides and polyphenols are also receiving a lot more interest in cosmeceutical applications for protecting skin from photodamage. The incorporation of algae in the diet for the management and prevention of chronic diseases like cancer, lung, and heart disease has been discussed in this review along with their action mechanism. This review provides a brief overview of several bioactive compounds present in micro and macroalgae and their therapeutic effect on lifestyle diseases, gastrointestinal diseases as well as neurodegenerative diseases.",10.1007/s13205-022-03454-2,review,WoS,"Kumari, Asmita", Garima," Bharadvaja, Navneeta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Journal of environmental management,2024,Process optimization and characterization of hydrolysate from underutilized brown macroalgae (Padina tetrastromatica) after fucoidan extraction through subcritical water hydrolysis,"The growing demand for macroalgal biomass as a source of proteins, peptides, and amino acids is garnering attention for their biological and functional properties. This study depicts the use of emerging green techniques, i.e. subcritical water, to hydrolyze protein from Padina tetrastromatica. The biomass was treated with subcritical water at varying temperatures between 100 and 220 degrees C for 10-40 min at a biomass to water proportion of 1:50 (w/v) and pressure of 4.0 MPa. The optimum conditions for recovering the maximum protein (127.2 +/- 1.1 mg g(-1)), free amino acids (58.4 +/- 1.0 mg g(-1)), highest degree of hydrolysis (58.8 +/- 1.2 %) and low molecular weight peptides (<650 Da) were found to be 220 degrees C for 10 min. The amino acid profiling of the hydrolysate revealed that it contains 45 % essential amino acids, with the highest concentration of methionine (0.18 %), isoleucine (0.12 %) and leucine (0.10 %). It was found that the hydrolysate contains phenolics (23.9 +/- 1.4 mg GAE g(-1)) and flavonoids (1.23 +/- 0.1 mg QE g(-1)), which are largely responsible for antioxidant activity. The hydrolysate effectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase and alpha-amylase in vitro, with IC50 values of 17.9 +/- 0.1 mg mL(-1) and 16.0 +/- 0.5 %, respectively, which can help prevent Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. Consequently, this study reveals that utilizing eco-friendly subcritical water hydrolysis method, 79 % of the protein was recovered from P. tetrastromatica, which might be an effective source of bioactive peptides in various nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119497,article,WoS,"Hans, Nidhi"," Solanki, Divyang"," Nagpal, Tanya"," Amir, Hirah"," Naik, Satyanarayan"," Malik, Anushree",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Journal of nutrition,2016,Lean Seafood Intake Reduces Postprandial C-peptide and Lactate Concentrations in Healthy Adults in a Randomized Controlled Trial with a Crossover Design,"Background: Recently we showed that lean seafood consumption reduced circulating triacylglycerol (TG) and VLDL concentrations and prevented an elevated total-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio relative to intake of a nonseafood diet.Objective: We aimed to elucidate whether diet-induced altered carbohydrate metabolism could be a contributing factor to the previously observed different lipoprotein patterns.Methods: This was a secondary outcome and explorative randomized controlled trial with a crossover design in 20 healthy adults (7 men and 13 women) that were 50.6 +/- 3.4 (mean +/- SEM) y old, weighed 75.7 +/- 2.5 kg, and had a body mass index (BM I, in kg/m(2)) of 25.6 +/- 0.7. After a 3-wk run-in period and separated by a 5-wk wash-out period, the participants consumed 2 balanced diets [in percentage of energy (energy%); 29% fat, 52% carbohydrates, 19% protein] for 4 wk. The diets varied in the main protein sources; 60 energy% of total protein was from either lean seafood or nonseafood sources. On the first and last day of each diet period, fasting and postprandial blood samples were collected before and after consumption of test meals (in energy%; 28% fat, 52% carbohydrates, 20% protein) with cod or lean beef.Results: The diets did not alter serum insulin and glucose concentrations. However, relative to the nonseafood diet period, the lean seafood diet period reduced postprandial C-peptide (P = 0.04) and lactate (P = 0.012) concentrations and fasting and postprandial TG/HDL-cholesterol ratios (P = 0.002). Hence, different postprandial lactate levels occurred at equal glucose concentrations.Conclusions: Even though the diets did not alter serum insulin and glucose concentrations, intake of the lean seafood compared with the nonseafood diet reduced postprandial concentrations of C-peptide and lactate and the TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio in healthy adults in a manner that may affect the long-term development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",10.3945/jn.115.229278,article,WoS,"Aadland, Eli K."," Graff, Ingvild E."," Lavigne, Charles"," Eng, Oyvin"," Paquette, Martine"," Holthe, Asle"," Mellgren, Gunnar"," Madsen, Lise"," Jacques, Helene"," Liaset, Bjorn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Journal of food science and technology-mysore,2015,Functional components and medicinal properties of food: a review,"Research has proved a relationship between functional components of food, health and well-being. Thus, functional components of food can be effectively applied in the treatment and prevention of diseases. They act simultaneously at different or identical target sites with the potential to impart physiological benefits and promotion of wellbeing including reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, inflammation, type II diabetes, and other chronic degenerative diseases, lowering of blood cholesterol, neutralization of reactive oxygen species and charged radicals, anticarcinogenic effect, low-glycaemic response, etc. Previously, it was thought that functional ingredients such as non-starchy carbohydrates including soluble and insoluble dietary fibres, fucoidan; antioxidants including polyphenols, carotenoids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, phytosterols, isoflavones, organosulphur compounds; plant sterols and soy phytoestrogens occur only in plant foods (whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) as phytochemicals. However, probiotics, prebiotics, conjugated linolenic acid, long-chain omega-3, -6 and -9-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and bioactive peptides have proved that functional components are equally available in animal products such as milk, fermented milk products and cold-water fish. The way a food is processed affects its functional components. Many processing techniques have been found to lower the concentration of functional components in food. Conversely, other techniques were found to increase them. Hence, in a time when the role of a healthy diet in preventing non-communicable diseases is well accepted, the borderline between food and medicine is becoming very thin.",10.1007/s13197-014-1396-5,review,WoS,"Abuajah, Christian Izuchukwu"," Ogbonna, Augustine Chima"," Osuji, Chijioke Maduka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marine drugs,2022,Marginal Impact of Brown Seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus Extract on Metabolic and Inflammatory Response in Overweight and Obese Prediabetic Subjects,"The objective of the present study was to test whether a brown seaweed extract rich in polyphenols combined with a low-calorie diet would induce additional weight loss and improve blood glucose homeostasis in association with a metabolic and inflammatory response in overweight/obese prediabetic subjects. Fifty-six overweight/obese, dysglycemic, and insulin-resistant men and women completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and parallel clinical trial. Subjects were administrated 500 mg/d of either brown seaweed extract or placebo combined with individualized nutritional advice for moderate weight loss over a period of 12 weeks. Glycemic, anthropometric, blood pressure, heart rate, body composition, lipid profile, gut integrity, and oxidative and inflammatory markers were measured before and at the end of the trial. No effect was observed on blood glucose. We observed significant but small decreases in plasma C-peptide at 120 min during 2 h-OGTT (3218 +/- 181 at pre-intervention vs. 2865 +/- 186 pmol/L at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 3004 +/- 199 at pre-intervention vs. 2954 +/- 179 pmol/L at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.002), heart rate (72 +/- 10 at pre-intervention vs. 69 +/- 9 (n/min) at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 68 +/- 9 at pre-intervention vs. 68 +/- 8 (n/min) at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.01), and an inhibition in the increase of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) (1.3 +/- 0.7 at pre-intervention vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 pg/L at post-intervention in the brown seaweed group; 1.4 +/- 1.1 at pre-intervention vs. 2.2 +/- 1.6 pg/L at post-intervention in the placebo group; changes between the two groups, p = 0.02) following brown seaweed consumption compared with placebo in the context of moderate weight loss. Although consumption of brown seaweed extract had no effect on body weight or blood glucose, an early attenuation of the inflammatory response was observed in association with marginal changes in metabolic parameters related to the prevention of diabetes type 2.",10.3390/md20030174,article,WoS,"Vodouhe, Marlene"," Marois, Julie"," Guay, Valerie"," Leblanc, Nadine"," Weisnagel, Stanley John"," Bilodeau, Jean-Francois"," Jacques, Helene",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Handbook of cholesterol: biology, function and role in health and diseases",2016,Cholesterol-containing foods for children and adolescents: recommendations catching up with research,"The world's obesity problem has many causes, although energy intake is always higher than output with excess stored as fat. Between 1976 and 2003, obesity in children 6-19 years in the US increased from 5-7% to 16-21%. Consequences of obesity are related to inflammation, oxidation, and adipocyte function, the latter a primary reason for loss of appetite control and increased blood glucose and blood pressure. Dietary intake is not the only cause, but controlling intake of low-nutrient-dense high-energy-dense foods must be part of the answer. Cholesterol-containing foods, restricted in part because of misinterpretation of research data decades ago, included eggs, dairy foods (even low-fat) ones, and red meat. Food intake by children and adolescents from NHANES 2003-2006 showed that 18% of energy came from baked goods, sugared soft drinks, and candy/sugary foods while 16% energy was provided by milk, eggs, and meat. Nutrients from the latter groups include vitamin D, calcium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin E, and iron, all of which are deficient in diets in the USA (shortfall), plus other nutrients. Research indicates that bioactive compounds and high quantities of many nutrients in milk result in benefits ranging from less inflammation to less adipose tissue in adolescents. Eggs have the highest quality protein available with carotenoids to prevent macular degeneration plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA), choline, and several deficient nutrients. However, decades of warnings not to eat them worked. Lean meat provides key nutrients in a low-energy form, including high quality protein and bioactive peptides most of which have an antihypertensive effect. Most studies show that lean meat either decreases risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease or has no effect. Fish and shellfish (not fried) can provide a plethora of nutrients, not the least of which is marine oils, DHA and eicosapentanoic acid. Parenting style and modeling the behaviors that they encourage can impact food choices of children. Encouraging intake of cholesterol-containing foods can improve nutritional health of children and adolescents.",10.3920/978-90-8686-821-6_15,survey,WoS,"Kubena, K. S."," McIntosh, W.
